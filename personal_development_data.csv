Image processing refers to the use of algorithms and techniques to analyze, transform, enhance, and manipulate digital images. 
It involves the application of various mathematical and computational methods to extract useful information from an image, 
correct image defects, and create new images. Image processing techniques can be used for a wide range of applications, 
including medical imaging, remote sensing, surveillance, computer vision, and digital photography. Some common tasks 
performed by image processing algorithms include: 


Image filtering: This involves the removal of noise, enhancement of image features, and smoothing of edges. 

Image segmentation: This involves dividing an image into meaningful regions, based on properties such as color, 
texture, and intensity. 

Image compression: This involves reducing the size of an image while preserving its quality, to save storage space 
and reduce transmission time. 

Image recognition: This involves the automatic identification of objects, patterns, and features in an image, using 
machine learning and computer vision techniques. 

Image restoration: This involves the recovery of lost or damaged image information, such as removing scratches, 
stains, and other defects. 


Overall, image processing plays an important role in many fields, enabling researchers and professionals to extract valuable 
insights and information from digital images.

Linux is an operating system that is free and open-source and is based on the Unix system. It 
was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds and has since become one of the most widely 
used operating systems in the world, powering everything from mobile devices to 
supercomputers. Linux is renowned for its dependability, flexibility, and safety. It is highly 
customizable and can be used for a wide range of applications, from servers and 
supercomputers to desktops and laptops. Linux distributions, or distros", are created by

Nor does this book contain everything you need to know about AutoHotkey. Rather it is a continuation of the learning process which started with A Beginner's Guide to AutoHotkey. If you are brand new to AutoHotkey and script writing then you may want to start with that book. If you already know the basics, then you may find this book worthwhile for the additional ideas and techniques it offers. If you're a more experienced programmer
The goal of this book is to help the novice and intermediate script writer become more familiar with AutoHotkey and programming. The more someone understands the nuances of a scripting language, the easier it is to write simple applications. While the AutoHotkey Command listing on the Web technically gives you everything that you need to write a script
There are a number of ways to remap Windows keyboard keys. Some of the early ways involved Windows Registry hacks. There is a program which makes the Registry changes a little easier called Sharpkeys. The program looks to be about six years old and I've never used it, but it should work with Windows 7 (I'm guessing). This is yet another problem which can be quickly solved with AutoHotkey.
To be a code writer you need the proper attitude. The average person doesn't know that programming is as creative a process as any of the arts and more inventive than most technical disciplines. There are many ways to get the job done. It's just that some solutions are more elegant than others. The object is to travel the path that will attain that goal. There may be many curves and a few dead-ends, but there is always a way to get there. The novice programmer needs to be aware of the frustrations associated with writing a script and develop the proper mindset for success. When armed with the knowledge and confidence to undertake the journey
New programmers also should understand that there is no such thing as a perfect program. In most cases there are many different ways of coding the same thing. The goal is to write code that works. It may not be pretty, but if it gets the result
"Most of us who work with computers have had the frustrating experience of ""losing"" an open window off the edges of the screen. It can sometimes be a real challenge to get the window back into the viewing frame. It would be useful to have an AutoHotkey script that when activated would display a list of the currently open windows", then upon selecting one
Change the System Tray icon, Chapter Twenty-two
"If you click the ""Change Icon..."" button", a window will open displaying the icons included within that program (see Figure 3). The path to the icons will be the same or similar to the program path
"Figure 3. The icons associated with an application are found by clicking the ""Change Icon..."" button in the Properties window. When used in an AutoHotkey routine the icons are designated based upon their location in this window as shown (Icon1", Icon2
One difference between this pop-up launch window and the Windows Start Menu or Taskbar is there is no icon or background change when you hover over a button with the cursor. If this is something you want then you can replace Text with the Button control (see Figure 5). The Button control will change color when the mouse hovers over the button. However, the Font control doesn't affect the color of the text in the button which will remain black.
I like the Favorite Links section of the navigation pane of Windows File Explorer which was first introduced with Windows Vista. (Note: The name Windows Explorer was changed to File Explorer in Windows 8. To save (or cause) confusion I use the term Windows File Explorer which opens with +E in all versions of Windows.) I slip my key editorial folders in and out of Favorite Links every week. However, it is fairly limited in space and only available when Windows File Explorer is open. What if there was an easy to access dropdown menu similar to the Windows' right-click menu which is always available
This is where I could have completely eliminated the ELSE portion of the conditional by setting the label on the first MENU statement to FolderHandler. Then that MENU statement would only need to be changed if files are found in the category folder, thus turning it into a submenu. Of course
I hadn't considered the fact that many people don't have a Windows key on their keyboard. My purpose in writing these apps is to use them as tools for learning how to write and use AutoHotkey scripts. Therefore, rather than merely making changes to the apps
Notice that Tray is used in place of the menu name. Tray always refers to the System Tray icon for the current AutoHotkey script. The Icon parameter is used to change the icon displayed. In this case it is icon number 43 found in the Windows System file SHELL32.dll. Later, when the file is compiled with the separate utility (discussed below)
"The second line of code noted merely changes the tool tip message to ""Right-click for QuickLinks", as shown in Figure 1.
"Now whenever someone wants to use ""athleticism"" it is automatically changed to"" athletic ability."" Too bad this doesn't work when the announcers are talking on air. I wanted to change it to"," ""It's 'athletic ability' you airhead!"
"I've also added a line to change ""on accident"" to ""on purpose"" since the former is obviously a Freudian slip used by people trying to hide the truth. Otherwise"," they would say ""by accident"" just like innocent people do. It turns out that ""on accident"" is commonly used by people under 35 while ""by accident"" is used by more mature individuals. Some put the blame on Barney and Friends"
To make any of these changes, install AutoHotkey and update the original AutoCorrect.ahk. Then you can either run the AHK file with the installed software or you can recompile it into the AutoCorrect.exe program which will run on any Windows computer.
If for some reason AutoCorrect is changing something you don't want changed, you can usually correct it by temporarily leaving out the space or punctuation at the end of the word (the correction won't activate)
"I've added the AutoCorrect app to all my computers. It impresses me when I see the typo ""thier"" change to ""their"" right before my eyes—regardless of which program or Web page I'm using. If you need to add a number of special characters to your keyboard", then it may be better to add them to the AutoCorrect.ahk file in a manner that makes them easy to remember.

While I've had some experience in past years with Regular Expressions before writing this book, I took on this project as much to learn about how to implement Regular Expressions in AutoHotkey as to teach their use to others. The deeper learning process was not easy and forced me through a number of mental gymnastics. Unlike AutoHotkey programming which almost anyone can quickly understand on a basic level
I started my work with the AutoHotkey RegEx Quick Reference online. It has all the information you need for most Regular Expressions. It is simple and straightforward without any embellishment. If you're an experienced programmer, then that' reference is probably all you will need to get started. But if you're like me
My goal in this book is to give enough insight into how RegEx works that it becomes a little easier to write and decipher one. Once understood they become much simpler to use. Plus, it's important to understand when they are most useful and how to implement them in AutoHotkey.
The number one reason for learning RegEx is that it is possible to do quite complex matching of strings of text with one line of code. The powerful options and wildcards used in the expressions can search through loads of text and files to find data which fit very specific, yet flexible
Note: This is a very basic introduction of how RegEx works which introduces a couple of the special symbols. The majority of this book uses specific AutoHotkey examples to add more of the inner workings and hidden mechanism involved in developing working Regular Expressions. When I started my learning process I used the short AutoHotkey script with follows to test my expressions. However, once I came across Ryan's RegEx Tester (also written in AutoHotkey)
The StringReplace command is fast for making changes in text, but the RegExReplace() function gives much more flexibility by finding a greater variety of matches while making corrections. RegExReplace() doesn't need to know the exact string
Remember that the goal was to prevent the entering of non-numeric digits (in particular the comma which sits right next to the decimal point on the main keyboard) into the Number of Servings editing field. If the variable does not evaluate as a number, then the total Calories calculation will return 0. I was using a number of tricks which included removing all non-digits and non-decimal points with:
"The center expression is changed from a word (\w+) to a wildcard (.*) which matches anything and everything between the first and last word—as long as it's in the same paragraph. The dot . means match any character and the asterisk * tells RegEx to continue matching until reaching the end of the string. The last space and word \s(\w+) continues to match at the end of the selected text. Now ""ribbons", bows
Note: You may have notice that sometimes I use the asterisk * to continue matching while other times I use the plus + sign. The two are practically interchangeable except in one way. The asterisk * will always match at the beginning of a string (zero or more), even if there is no matching character. The plus + sign only matches if the character is found (one or more). Put another way the plus + sign demands a match while the asterisk * isn't so picky. In most cases it probably won't make much difference which you use
Note; I wrote this chapter early in my learning process before I started using Ryan's RegEx Tester discussed in previous chapters. This short script is an effective RegEx test, but does not have the power of Ryan's Tester. In most cases I would use Ryan's app

What distinguishes this cool AutoHotkey magnifier app are the features. You can change the level of magnification by selecting the value in the upper left-hand corner menu. You can even reduce the size by half. This screen magnifier has adjustments for magnification, anti-aliasing (smoothing)
None of the examples in this chapter are my scripts. They are written by people who are endowed with far more programming skill than I possess. However, I have slightly modified a few of them for my purposes. Although I may not understand how everything works in each script
Clipboard History is another way to work with the ClipJump clips without using the paste (CTRL+V) operation. Open Clipboard History with WIN+C (+C) or the System Tray right-click menu shown in Figure 1. (While the Clipboard History key combination can't be changed in the Settings window, it can be changed by editing the appropriate line in the settings.ini file found in the working folder.) Clipboard History is updated every time a new clip is added to any channel. It operates independently of the channels
A ClipJump channel is an isolated section of ClipJump which stores clips while it is active. This is convenient for saving related clips for later use. When adding clips to any channel they are also added to the Clipboard History—although not the other channels. When using the ClipJump paste operation (CTRL+V) only the clips in the active channel are accessed. The channels are created and change with the ClipJump Channels window, SHIFT+CTRL+C (see Figure 5).
There are only two decisions to make. The first is the hotkey combination. To create a hotkey combination you must combine at least one modifier (CTRL," ALT or SHIFT) with a letter or number key. Hold the keys down simultaneously and they will appear in the hotkey field. If you use an invalid combination the value of the combination will return to ""None."" (Note: If you type a single key other than one of the modifiers"
You can use the ShowHotkey option at the bottom of the icon right-click menu in the System Tray to change the insertion text by editing the old text and clicking the Set Key Combo button. If you need a different combination (usually due to interference with another Windows or program hotkey)," you can change the key combination in the same manner by editing the hotkey combination and clicking the Set Key Combo button. The old hotkey combination will be cancelled. To exit the InstantHotkey app select Exit from the right-click menu or change the key combo to ""None"" and click the set button."
It's important to note that each time the Set Key Combo button is clicked it creates the new hotkey. If you change the hotkey combination, then it will turn on the new hotkey without turning off the old one. All hotkeys created will continue to work (giving the identical output) until the app is exited. This isn't very elegant. To turn off the old hotkey requires saving it in a new variable. This could be done by adding the line
I added a couple of minor features QuikPlay to make things a little easier. Note that that while files are playing the activation hotkeys +ALT+P will not work. To change the selection, you must first stop (use +ALT+S) the current list
The primary change from the original AddItem label is the use of the LV_Modify(SelectedRow,
The last precaution is to save the data to the text file when exiting the app. While in most cases this probably won't be necessary since the script updates the file on virtually every change, it can't hurt. First the OnExit command is added in the auto-execute section of the script:
I noticed that the window is a fixed size and can't be maximized or changed, only minimized or closed. Also
"I glad to hear that you want to extend the little script ""beyond that of a to-do list."" That is the entire purpose of all the writing I do about AutoHotkey. The fact that one of the apps I talk about may be directly beneficial to someone is incidental to my goal of helping more people use AutoHotkey to enhance their Windows computing experience. Too many people are ready to accept the standard way of doing things", not realizing how many basic AutoHotkey tricks can simplify their computing life.
"Ron also noted that ""that the window is a fixed size and can't be maximized or changed"" in the ToDoList.ahk script. Using the AutoHotkey app is much easier if people can resize a GUI window to suit themselves. There is a simple way to make a GUI window resizable. Among the other GUI +/-options", such as +AlwaysOnTop
This is a powerful label since it ties changes in the size and position of GUI controls to the resizing of the main GUI window in real-time. It works with the GuiControl, Move command by continually updating the width (w)

When working with file structures it helps to understand that each line of text in a file traditionally ends with a carriage return and a line feed. This is based upon simulating the movement on typewriters when starting a new line. (This video shows what can happen to a skilled typewriter typist when using a computer.) On a computer new lines are started by first issuing a carriage return (`r is the escaped character used in AutoHotkey) which places the pointer at the beginning of the line, then issuing the line feed command (`n is the escaped character used in AutoHotkey) which moves the pointer to a new line. It is the same net effect as using a typewriter to start a new line
To remove empty lines all double line feeds (`n`n) are replaced with single line feeds (`n). This is not the best method for removing all extra lines. If there happens to be three or more line feeds in a row only pairs will be changed to singles as they are encountered which could leave some double line feeds. To replace them all, the same command needs to be rerun until there are no doubles line feeds left. To ensure that all double line feeds are gone
This subroutine is executed with the CTRL++ALT+C food import hotkey combination because the value of either Food4 or Food5 changes when the data is imported to the fields. After that, every time an adjustment is made in either edit field

Tip: If you want to protect the Edit field from accidental changes, then add:
to the script. This will prevent changes to the Edit field until a GuiControl, -ReadOnly
There is no point in saving data to the file if it hasn't changed. I looked for ways to visually indicate that some editing had occurred, but there were few options. One method that does the job is using the GuiControl command to change the background color of the TreeView. (This technique doesn't work for the Edit field since it does not have the +background as an option.) By adding the line:
If we have made any changes, then it would be nice to be warned before we exit the app and lose all those changes. This is where the RecipeChange variable comes in handy. The GuiClose label triggers whenever there is an attempt to exit the script:
If there are no changes (If RecipeChange = 0)," the app exits immediately. Otherwise a MsgBox command queries whether you want to save the data. If ""No"
With the example in Figure 1 selecting Start QuikPlay App launches the music playing app QuikPlay.exe (see Chapter Five). The red dot changes to a green dot and the No becomes a Yes. When right-clicking on QuikPlay again, the menu items are now all enabled and the last item is Exit QuikPlay App (see Figure 2). Clicking on the last option again reverses the process.
While these changes are primarily cosmetic, they make the QuickLinks script a little easier to use. You can find the current versions of the various QuickLinks script in the QuickLinks.zip file found at ComputorEdge AutoHotkey Dropbox download Web site.
I certainly don't mind you asking questions. I'm in the process of compiling another e-book with over thirty more chapters and your questions help me to see what issues people are facing when learning AutoHotkey. Plus, you give me more ideas.

If you find that you are having conflicts between AutoHotkey scripts that you're combining with the #Include command, then you will most likely need to modify the scripts. The first method may be to combine the auto-execute sections from each script into the first script included. This may be a major rework of the scripts
When first learning AutoHotkey and looking through the online AutoHotkey documentation, this GUI naming option is not readily apparent. I have not discussed it in any of my previous chapters nor the beginner's books mostly because the scripts I was demonstrating only had one GUI window (if any) and did not produce the conflicts caused by running multiple GUI windows. For most basic AutoHotkey apps
While conflicting AutoHotkey GUI windows is an obvious problem when combining two (or more) AutoHotkey scripts into one, there are a number of other issues that need to be addressed. But first how AutoHotkey processes a script when it is loaded must be understood. The better you know how AutoHotkey reads and runs the script files (AHK)
This is a form of reverse engineering for AutoHotkey scripts. By learning what each step does you get tremendous insight into how AutoHotkey works. However, I do caution that although the script replicates the exact actions taken during the record session

communications between computers, which typically communicate in short bursts of data
DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; formerly ARPA) supported initiatives for ground-based and satellite-based packet networks. The ground-based packet radio system provided mobile access to computing resources, while the packet satellite network connected the United States with several European countries and enabled connections with widely dispersed and remote regions.
A strong motivation thus existed to connect the packet radio network to ARPANET in order to allow mobile users with simple terminals to access the time-sharing systems for which they had authorization. Similarly, the packet satellite network was used by DARPA to link the United States with satellite terminals serving the United Kingdom
By the 1980s other U.S. governmental bodies were heavily involved with networking, including the National Science Foundation (NSF)
The Internet has evolved from the integration of two very different technological agendas—the Cold War networking of the U.S. military and the personal computer (PC) revolution. The first agenda can be dated to 1973, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sought to create a communications network that would support the transfer of large data files between government and government-sponsored academic-research laboratories. The result was the ARPANET

In addition to serving as a medium for the exchange of articles, the Internet can facilitate the discussion of scientific work long before it appears in print.

HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language focused on structure and presentation. It works in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing web pages. As a foundational technology in web development, HTML continues to evolve with new versions
as a “request for comment” project meant that programmers could submit feedback for consideration in new updates. HTML 2.0 was first created to standardize the features users were already utilizing HTML to perform. However, programmers wanted new features as well. HTML 2.0 underwent several updates during 1995
SCRIPT reserved for future use with scripting languages. STYLE reserved for future use with style sheets. META used to supply meta info as name/value pairs. LINK used to define relationships with other documents. TITLE, SCRIPT and STYLE are containers and require both
If you have used any software you will have undoubtedly noticed how every few months it advances its number. Until they improved it and it became Firefox 2.1. Adding a decimal to the version number signifies a minor change to the original. When major changes are made to a software project, they will move up a whole number to version 3. This is the same way most dynamic things work. As you can see
Of course there will be challenges ahead, there always are. Workers will have to obtain more extensive training than they did in decades past
Machine learning is one of the most exciting and vibrant areas of research in science and engineering today. In this book we are going to introduce you to the world of machine learning, beginning with a discussion of how machines and computers have evolved along with humans over our long history.
After this we will discuss the steps that are followed in machine learning, including collecting data
Artificial intelligence can be described as the development of computer systems that perform tasks normally done by humans. A simple example of artificial intelligence would be a visual perception system. Of course this isn’t “simple” in the dense that a computer system that does visual perception is simple from a technology perspective or in the amount of challenge involved, but a small child has extremely well developed abilities of visual perception
This is also the core of artificial intelligence. That is the idea behind artificial intelligence is to have machines that can learn from experience, and adjust their algorithms appropriately.
This is where machine learning comes in. The concept behind machine learning is simple (to describe). You develop a computer system that is able to learn from data it’s exposed to, improve it’s performance
Since computer systems that use machine learning improve their performance with experience (in the form of being exposed to large amounts of data), they do have some aspects of human-like intelligence at least in a gross sense. Underneath the hood
The algorithmic models look for relationships and patterns in the data in order to make predictions about the outputs. The data itself will configure the structure of the model rather than having a computer programmer do it. The system has to be exposed to a large amount of data, otherwise its not going to be able to accurately determine the underlying relationships in the data and use that to make future predictions. Remember that in the real world
We can think of an example of how machine learning could be applied in the real world. Imagine developing a machine learning model that could be used to approve an application for a loan. The model would be fed data on large numbers of people who had applied for this type of loan in the past. The data could include demographic, educational
There are two phases of development using machine learning that are used before it’s ready to be actually applied in the real world. In the first phase, the algorithmic model is developed by feeding it training data. During this phase
Machine learning also has some fun applications. Big video game companies are using machine learning algorithms to have their games learn from the experience just as the player is doing so, and this can make the games more challenging as the player advances to new levels.
The overall goal of artificial intelligence has traditionally been to get computers to perform tasks that they are not very good at now, but that humans can do really well. In the early days of artificial intelligence
Machine learning is used throughout the world of business and government. The applications are wide ranging and varied, after all this is meant to be a generalized method that can be used to apply computing power. We’ve already touched on a couple of specific examples
The military is utilizing machine learning for all of its operations. This will help the military develop more efficient machines that can operate without significant or any human input. Depending on the application, this can be seen as a positive or as something that might raise ethical concerns.
Target recognition is an important application of machine learning for the military. Machine learning can help soldiers identify and track possible targets. This can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of targeting operations in real time, while reducing the risk of creating civilian casualties. In the training phase
One area where machine learning is proving to be valuable is in cyber security. Algorithms that have been trained using machine learning can help detect fraudulent attempts to access a network, deal with cyber attacks
The internal revenue service is another federal department that has increased the role of machine learning in its operations in recent years. In particular, the IRS is interested in using machine learning to help detect fraud and identity theft. It can also study past data from fraud cases in order to detect patterns that emerge from this data
The Centers for Disease Control is beginning to use machine learning for a wide variety of purposes. For example, one proposal is to use machine learning to study epidemics. This could help healthcare workers identify epidemics faster
Local governments are using machine learning as well, to help deliver services more efficiently and prevent fraud and theft. While it’s controversial
Another area that machine learning has taken over when it comes to financial services is credit checks and loan approval. The days of having to speak to a loan officer are rapidly disappearing, and in some cases are already gone. This is actually one of the most straightforward applications of machine learning
We’ve already noted that Southwest and other airlines have been able to use machine learning to allocate their resources more effectively and to avoid wasting fuel and time unnecessarily. The same techniques used by the airlines can be used in any application involving mass transit, or with hauling and shipping. For example
Machine learning has immediate application to the oil and gas industry, and also to mining. One area where it can be used is in the search for new deposits or energy sources. This can make companies far more efficient when they seek out areas for experimental drilling. Using machine learning
Everyone is talking about it these days – you are probably seeing ads online that seem to read your mind. The technology that lies behind these systems is based on machine learning. If you are looking for a new pair of shoes, you are going to see advertisements for shoes all over the place. It’s not clear that this always works
One interesting area where machine learning is starting to have an impact is in healthcare. While medicine often requires a lot of problem solving skills and interpretation from medical professionals, a lot of it is rule based
Machine learning can also be used as an assistant for a doctor in more complex cases. An algorithm can spot something that a doctor might miss, leading to more accurate diagnoses and treatment.
Machine learning can also be used to help with staffing, scheduling appointments
The job of the data scientist is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and come up with results. Ultimately a human must interpret and direct, choosing which algorithms to use and which to actually employ after training. Once they are employed however
Machine learning is a tool that is useful for data scientists. By utilizing machine learning, the data scientist can increase their productivity by allowing the machine learning systems to do a lot of pattern recognition without the need of direct human intervention
Data science will use statistical modeling and machine learning among its tools, but what are the goals or outcomes that data science hopes to deliver? There are many ways that data science can be used. We can’t possibly list them all
Data science and machine learning is finding many uses in a field known as prescriptive analytics. In this case, the machine learning is used in order to accomplish some specific tasks. Researchers in this area are aiming high
There are many ways that pattern recognition can be used in machine learning. For example, criminal behavior often follows distinct patterns. Auto thefts are going to occur in some specific areas of a city far more often than they occur in other areas. They may occur more often during particular times of year. Sure
Data science has been used by industry to make big changes and safe money in their operations. In one famous example, Southwest Airlines claims it determined how much time its planes were spending idling on the tarmac before takeoff
If you are interested in a career that uses machine learning, data science is but one path. You always have the option of going straight through computer science with a specialty in machine learning. It’s a certainty that you will be very employable if you choose this path.
In the earlier chapters we have just glossed over the concept of machine learning. It turns out that there are four major types of machine learning that need to be considered. In this chapter we are going to find out what they are, and how they are used in order to achieve the goal of machine learning. There are four main types of machine learning that are used. These include supervised learning
With supervised learning, the goal is to determine a functional relationship or mapping between outputs Y and inputs X. You can think of this as a mapping relationship that would be similar to mathematics. That is Y is some function of the inputs X:
The job of the algorithm during training is to find the patterns behind the relationship between X and Y. Eventually, the system would be able to predict the outputs Y for new inputs X for which the results were not known in advance.
Data used for supervised learning is grouped in a row and column format, just like a spreadsheet. Each column is given a label called an attribute. The various characteristics of a data point or object are also known as features. A single data point would consist of one row from the data set. So a single data point can have multiple attributes. Data can be numerical or categorical
Here is an example dataset organized in this fashion. Suppose we have a group of people and we want to predict whether or not they will have diabetes in five years. The challenge in this case might be to determine if one ethnicity or another has a higher risk of developing diabetes, given similar input conditions.
A set of data points that are input for machine learning of the form (A,B
Supervised learning follows a path of well defined steps. This begins with human input, by selecting the types of training examples that are going to be used in the training process. Once that has been decided
Here we again imagine using a process to build multiple machine learning models, each one trained on its own data set. A variance error is the error between the prediction of the model and the actual result when one data point is considered. In the earlier section
Another error that can arise with machine learning is the case of measurement or human error when the input data is concerned. Measurement error is common, and of course we all know that human error when it comes to data input can be common as well. It’s straightforward to recognize that bad input data is going to train the algorithm badly
Classification systems can go well beyond simple binary classification. Examples of this include speech recognition and handwriting analysis. There are several types of algorithms that can be used in machine learning for classification purposes. We will review these in more detail later, but list them here for reference:
It’s possible to have a hybrid model between the two. This is called semi-supervised learning. When this training method is used, a subset of the data will be labeled
Active learning is an interesting and powerful variation of this. When using active learning, the machine can request output data as part of the learning process. Some of the data sets used in training for these purposes could be labeled
In supervised learning, the training session involves the programmer or data scientists feeding the machine or algorithm data sets that not only include sample data
Different situations will call for different approaches. That means that sometimes supervised learning will be more appropriate to use, while at other times unsupervised learning will be the better choice.
Clustering is a relatively easy form of machine learning to understand. The basic principle behind clustering is that you can take any set of data and group it or classify it in different ways. Let’s take the diabetes example once again. If we are interested in what people are most likely to get diabetes over a specified time period, we could group the data by: age ranges
Using unsupervised learning, there is an open ended approach to pattern recognition
We use unsupervised learning with neural networks, and so they are not going to be fed the correct output answers. Instead they will get unlabeled data. The basic structure of a neural network is shown below. On the left
In this section we will cover the third type of unsupervised learning that we are going to discuss in the book. This is called the Markov algorithm. This type of algorithm can be used when you want to take a data set and translate it into a different type of data set. The data in the Markov algorithm are sets of strings. It searches for patterns in the sets of strings that should be replaced. The rules that are used for the operation of the Markov algorithm have been described as “grammar like”. The translation method used is a simple substitution formula. An easy application of this would be in the transcription of DNA and RNA. You may recall that the DNA uses four nitrogen bases that form the basis of the code. These are adenine, thymine
We saw that in the case of supervised learning, the answers to each input in the data set were provided during the training phase. Reinforcement learning withholds the answers
Another difference between reinforcement learning and supervised learning is that reinforcement learning uses sequential inputs. This works in the following way. The model is presented with the first input. Then the second input to the model depends on the first output. This process is continued on through the data. In the next iteration The second output would then be a dependency for the third input, and so on.
So the formal definitions of positive and negative reinforcement in reinforcement learning when it comes to machines are actually similar. Let’s take the case of negative reinforcement first. In negative reinforcement, a reward is given when a negative behavior is avoided. This will strengthen the behavior of the agent toward the correct end goal. However
Humans also learn in part through this interaction model. One common way that reinforcement learning is explained is to imagine a child approaching a fire. Suppose that it’s winter and it’s cold outside because there has been a major snowstorm. A child may approach the fireplace in order to get warmth. As the child approaches, the child feels better. They can get very close to the fire
Reinforcement learning begins with the system in a certain state, or configuration. If you are unfamiliar with this concept
An agent in machine learning will be operating in some kind of environment. This kind of model is often used in video games, and so the environment will be the scene that the game is played in. In the case of chess
Reinforcement learning is a loop based system. After the agent has made it’s first move, the new situation forms the basis for the input to the next state. You can view a chess game as iterating through a series of different states. As each player makes their move
In reinforcement learning, the goal of the procedure of reward for good behavior is to maximize the reward in a cumulative fashion. Think of it as saving money in the bank. You are rewarded the most by saving money at regular intervals
The concept of short term and long term rewards is considered with reinforcement learning. The idea behind this is the following. You might have your eye on the ultimate prize, which is the long-term reward. However
Temporal difference learning is also known as Q-Learning. The key here is that you get the reward when you get the reward. It doesn’t matter what the state of the system is, so you’re not waiting to reach the next level.
Reinforcement learning can be divided into episodes. Each episode has states, actions
There are many different algorithms to choose from when considering machine learning. In order to get a firmer grasp on how this all works behind the scenes, let’s take a look at some of the most important algorithms that are used. These include linear regression
Since linear regression gives you a straight line representation of the relationship between the input and output variables, it’s the same equation of a line that you remember from school. It’s in the form:
When used in machine learning, the job of the system is to learn on a large data set to determine the values of m and b as accurately as possible. The more data and more iterations that are used
Researchers are going to note certain things about the relationship between the input and output variables. For example, what is the trend? If the line is sloped upwards
Logistic regression is another method used to determine a statistical relationship between input and output variables. In this case the first situation we are going to look at is when the output variable is binary, that is it can only have one of two states. This can be yes or no
Of course the system is going to make mistakes. Many emails that fall below the decision boundary will actually be emails that the user wants to receive. However, since machine learning systems are always able to learn
A decision tree can be used for categorical or numerical data. You can think of moving through the decision tree by asking a question at each branch or node. These are called decision nodes, and they are made up of two or more branches. A leaf node is called a classification or decision. The best predictor is the root of the tree
One area where decision trees can be used effectively is with simple medical diagnoses. For example, we could determine whether or not a patient has a bacterial sinus infection or not. The decision tree would ask multiple questions that were arrived at by training the machine learning algorithm. The training would enable the algorithm to find patterns in the data that could be used to determine whether or not a specific patient was likely to have a viral
Decision trees can be numerical but are typically oriented to classification problems similar to those we have illustrated here. The rules that are generated with decision trees are actually simple and easy to understand. They can be read and understood by a human observer, even if large data sets were used to generate them.
Since the primary use of decision trees is simple classification, they are not computationally intensive. As you can see from the examples given
A random forest is a variation on a decision tree that attempts to overcome its weaknesses. In many applications, a decision tree will be more than adequate for the tasks that you are facing. However
So a random forest consists of multiple decision trees. The decision trees are random. One way that they are made random is to build a given tree on a random sample from the training data. That means that each tree in the random forest will have used a unique data set for it’s training. During the construction of the tree, splitting at nodes is done in a random fashion. This is done by randomly selecting which attributes to use at each node.
You use k to pick out the top k rows of the data. Since our data is organized by distance, it picks out the k-nearest neighbors. Remember the top row of the data is the smallest distance between data points.
Machine learning is a very exciting field of study. In this book we’ve learned a lot about how machine learning is done, including how to teach the algorithm and all the various types of algorithms that are available. We’ve also learned a great deal about supervised and unsupervised learning
One of the challenges of machine learning will be selecting the right algorithm for the right problem. You’re also going to need to know how to determine what data sets to use for training, and whether or not you should use supervised or unsupervised learning. These are some of the many challenges that a newbie will face when trying to enter into this field. It’s important to learn all of the nuance associated with these questions and others
It is a good exercise to write down a list of twenty common problems that are tackled using machine learning. Then for each problem, determine whether or not it is a classification problem
The learning portion of the process of developing a model is one of the most important. You need to understand why you would choose supervised over unsupervised learning, or vice versa. Remember that it’s not whether or not one is ultimately better than the other or not
Many people get overly excited about the algorithms and the process of machine learning itself. Equally important however, is the data that you select to use in your training. If you choose the wrong data that can mean that your model delivers bad or irrelevant results. Your career as a data scientist will be short lived indeed
It’s important to learn from the experiences of others, seeing what types of data are best suited to different algorithms. Sometimes
One of the most popular tools used for machine learning is Python. The first thing to note about Python is that it’s a lite tool. Second, you can use it on any system. Python is fast and great to use for calculation
There are also many well regarded free resources that can be used to teach yourself how to do coding with Python. You can find many videos on YouTube, or consider taking a low priced course on Udemy. You might check out the Kahn Academy which remains free and offers a huge library of videos that will help you become a master of nearly any subject.
Another tool that is widely used in studies of machine learning is R. This is a package made for mathematicians. The purpose of R is to provide a ready made suite of tools that can be used for statistical analysis. R can perform virtually any task that we have described in this book, and it’s particularly suited for linear regression and least-squares problems. I do not believe that R charges for you to download and try the program. You might look for some books on R to learn it thoroughly if you decide that you want to use it.
In addition to learning R and Python, you should definitely be learning statistics and probability at an advanced level. That doesn’t mean you have to actually get a PhD to do it. But you should take as many courses on these subjects as possible
An important tip that has served me well is to try mixed learning models when I don’t seem to be getting the results I expect from one type or another. If you are not seeing results from supervised learning, then consider using a subset of your data for unsupervised learning
This is a great way to breathe new life into a project that seems to be going nowhere. If something is stuck, it can help you revitalize things and get it launched off the ground. Don’t be afraid to try multiple approaches. One of the worst things that can happen to any engineer or scientist is to get caught up with just one or two beloved approaches that they are afraid to give up. Or
It’s important to have realistic expectations. Not every case of machine learning is going to be the next big breakthrough. In fact, in some applications machine learning might produce disappointing results. If that is the case for one of your projects
Machine learning has been one of the most exciting developments to come out of computer science and artificial intelligence in a very long time. Of course machine learning began its long road to its present form many decades ago. But it’s only recently that we’ve seen machine learning getting widespread application to the extent that it’s actually changing the way that society is operating. Understanding these changes is going to be one of the most important things going forward for the data science community and society at large. I try to stay optimistic, there are some reasons for concern but I have to keep believing that Machine learning is going to provide many tools which are going to help improve peoples lives. Every tool development machine learning doesn’t have to be the most dramatic and breakthrough development of that man has ever seen. We can probably go through history and I would have to say that people like Nicholas Tesla or Thomas Edison we’re probably a lot more impactful on society then a lot of the new technologies that we are seeing today. I would say that’s the truth for any given individual technology. However when you take a look at the sum total of the changes that we are seen from machine learning
It’s hard to say where the future machine learning lies, but one thing it’s going to do is allow people to have a more personalized existence. We’ve already seen great strides towards this over the past decade or so. Now everything is personally curated from music to videos. This process is in their early stages of development. It’s only going to accelerate in the coming decades.
Machine learning is becoming more and more important as time goes by. This is an exciting time to enter computer science and data science and learn how to use these tools in order to complete amazing tasks. Although machine learning seems brand new, the concept of machines and learning goes back to the dawn of time. Human beings have always been tool makers and tool users
Hopefully they won’t stop this exciting engine. I suspect they won’t be able to. Governments and corporations are already in love with machine learning. The reason is simple. Machine learning works. After decades of oversold promises, computers are now in a position where they can learn
Working with machine learning is a different type of activity than traditional computer programming. Of course traditional computer programming is still around and alive and well, so let’s not kill it off yet.
This book is made for all those interested in learning from scratch how to start coding and programming on Python. If you already have some knowledge of this language or another one, you will find very interesting and important information here that we are sure you didn’t know.
Learning Python for beginners is basically like learning to write and to interpret that writing, this language has a very reduced vocabulary
It is the extraction of knowledge from a variety of structured and unstructured volumes through the use of data mining techniques and predictive analysis. What is basically wanted is to combine several tools to obtain an expected result. All this is achieved with Machine learning, data mining
In the case of Machine Learning, we are talking about an area whose objective is to develop algorithms that allow computers to learn.
In order to better understand the concept of Machine Learning (ML), let's start with a brief summary of some of the applications that are made with ML
• Supervised Learning Algorithms: this type of learning occurs when an algorithm learns from data from examples and associated target responses, which may consist of numerical values or string labels
• Unsupervised learning algorithms: refers to when the algorithm learns from simple examples without any associated response, letting the algorithm determine the data patterns itself. For example
• Reinforced Learning Algorithm: in this type of learning, the algorithm decides how to act to perform its task. In the absence of training data
• Learning by Natural Language Procedure: this learning formulates effective mechanisms for communication between people and machines by means of natural languages. For example, spelling and grammar correction
• Deep Learning: uses the principles of the basic ML algorithms together, attempting to model high-level abstractions in data using computer architecture. It is a complex definition
Artificial intelligence is booming; some think it is a new revolution that could change the life of our planet. Turing thought that if a machine behaves in all aspects as intelligent, then it must be intelligent. So
• PyBrain: it is an automatic learning library, by modules that has a great variety of environments to test.
If you have some kind of experience programming," for example in ""C"
Modules allow us to organize the elements and components inside our codes in an easier way, providing us with a big package of variables that are auto contained. Names that are defined on a superior level in a module file automatically will become an attribute of the object of the imported module.
The main reason why we think that the modules are a very useful tool when it comes to programming is that they are really helpful to organize and reuse our code. This is very important when we talk about OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) since on that mode, the modularization and reusage are very popular. Since Python is a programming language oriented for that
• Message: We define a message as the direct communication to the object, this one is going to order itself to execute some of its methods with the parameters that it contains associated
As we have been learning, in Python
There are several serial communication protocols, but in this case
Some of the projects that you could do with serial communication and Python are device automation, equipment instrumentation
The next step is to start programming with all the tools we provided you in this book in order to keep improving your programming skills. As you could have seen, programming is not a very hard activity
If you would rather not work with anything that is too complicated when it comes to your computer skills, then you would want to pick out one of the distributions that are present that are meant to work well for newbies of Linux. Ubuntu
If you went through and changed up the size of the partition that you were working within Windows, you are going to be asked to work on a disk check. This is not something that is necessary to work with
We need to spend some time learning how to run commands in this command shell. Running some of the commands that you would like in fish is going to be the same as you are able to do with some of the other shells that are there. You will just need to type in the command, along with some of the other arguments that you need to go with it. The spaces are going to be the way that we are able to separate this out. This is going to be similar to some of the commands that we talked about earlier in this guidebook as well. Let’s look at an example of this one below:
There are going to be a few methods that we are able to use when it is time to handle our variables. First on the list is the global variables. Most of the distributions that you are able to use of Linux is going to ask you to change or add the variable definitions in the path of/etc/profile, or to some other location that makes the most sense to what you are trying to do.
Another benefit that we will spend a bit of time on is how friendly the Linux network is overall. As this operating system is an option that is open source and is contributed by the team over the internet network, it is also able to effectively manage the process of networking all of the time. And it is going to help with things like commands that are easy to learn and lots of libraries that can be used in a network penetration test if you choose to do this. Add on that the Linux system is going to be more reliable and it is going to make the backup of the network more reliable and faster and you can see why so many users love to work with this option.
In this chapter you will be introduced to a diverse area of ethical penetration testing. It is also referred to as ethical hacking and is defined as a technical procedure and methodology which gives professional hackers a platform to simulate the techniques and actions that real-life hackers would use in the exploitation of an information system or a computer network. We are going to learn the steps that are usually followed by the penetration tester right from the understanding and analysis of a select target to the actual break-in. The book also covers topics dealing with the numerous tools that are used in the penetration testing exercise. These are briefly introduced in this chapter but will be covered in depth in chapter 4. The reader will get to understand the practical applications of Kali Linux in the real world besides knowing how to download and install this distribution of Linux. So, let us get into it without further ado.
Offensive Security is the company behind this wonderful distribution. Kali Linux is the company’s latest release. Kali is a live disk security distribution having over 300 penetration testing and security tools. If you have prior experience with the operating system, you may have noticed that the tools have been categorized into groups that are commonly utilized by penetration testers and any other entities doing the assessment of information systems. Kali Linux utilizes Debian 7.0
The name change to Kali Linux, according to Offensive Security
12) Stress testing: If you want to carry out stress testing of your network, VOIP environment
A penetration testing exercise will not be complete if a presentation of disclosed vulnerabilities is not done. Verified and exploited vulnerabilities should be well documented, reported and presented. Ethically speaking
This is a professional penetration tester whose main job is to carry out an attack on the computer or network systems for an organization or a particular owner of the information system. In this book, you will note that Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing are used interchangeably.
This is a terminology used to describe a person who uses his IT skills for bypassing the security of information systems without permission. The intention of black hats is normally to commit computer crimes. Red Team members, together with Penetration Testers
That will help to minimize networking complications. Once you are done choosing a hostname, hit the Continue button to proceed. On the next screen
Navigating the filesystem from the terminal is an essential Linux skill. To get anything done, you need to be able to move around to find applications
To change directories from the terminal, use the change directory command
The prompt changes to root@kali:/etc, indicating that we’re in the /etc. directory. We can confirm this by entering pwd
The second command for file creation is touch. This command was initially developed so a user could touch a file to change some of its details, such as the date it was created or modified. However
Like all good projects, ethical hacking also has a set of distinct phases. It helps hackers to make a structured ethical hacking attack.Different security training manuals explain the process of ethical hacking in different ways
This is a scenario where secret communication tunnels are used for transmitting data. Examples of such paths include HTTP tunnels, DNS tunnels
There are many advantages to using wireless networking. However, this kind of technology comes with a host of threats and vulnerabilities that hackers can take advantage of. Since information is sent over the air via radio frequencies
A malicious hacker injects counterfeit networking re-configuration commands into an access point that does not filter traffic. These fake commands bring down the entire network or switches, routers and hubs
The steps below will show you exactly how to go about spoofing the MAC address of a client who is authorized to connect to the network. The Wi-Fi adapter should be in monitoring mode. Airodump-ng on Kali Linux will be used to recover the MAC address. After this, the Macchanger program will be used to do the spoofing
1. Make sure your Wi-Fi adapter is in monitoring mode. To find the wireless network that is being targeted as well as any clients connected to it, enter this command:
Now that the MAC address of your wireless adapter has been changed to that of an authorized user, test and see if the network will authenticate your login. You should be able to connect to the wireless network.
Change default identifier — Every router has a default ID given to it by its manufacturer. You may have switched off the identifier broadcaster, but hackers can still attack the network if they find out the default ID
Change the default password — Every router is assigned a default password by the manufacturer. This is for purposes of configuring the device initially. These default passwords are easy to find, so make sure that you change your router password to something that will be very difficult to crack. Also
The CIA paradigm faces immense challenges where big data is involved. This is primarily because of the sheer volume needing to be kept safe, the variety of formats of the data
We define encryption as a mechanism through which plaintext or other data type are changed from their currently readable form to an encoded way. It is only an entity having access to a decryption key that can decode the data. This is an important measure that usually is used to provide end-to-end data security across networks. Encryption, as a proactive security measure
Network scanning comprises of two key aspects: vulnerability scanning and network port scanning. The latter denotes a way of sending data packets through a network over to a systems’ specific port numbers. The goal is to discover network services that are present in that particular system. It is an excellent way for troubleshooting issues that a given system has. That way, the problems can be dealt with so that the system is secure. For us to discover known vulnerabilities present in network systems
If you have a wireless adapter, you can use the iwconfig command to gather crucial information for wireless hacking
Being able to change your IP address and other network information is a useful skill because it will help you access other networks while appearing as a trusted device on those networks. For example, in a denial of service (DoS) attack
To change your IP address, enter ifconfig
You can also change your network mask (netmask) and broadcast address with the ifconfig command. For instance, if you want to assign that same eth0 interface with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255
You can also use ifconfig to change your MAC address. The MAC address is globally unique and is often used as a security measure to keep hackers out of networks —or to trace them. Changing your MAC address to spoof a different MAC address is almost trivial and neutralizes those security measures. Thus, it’s an instrumental technique for bypassing network access controls. To spoof your MAC address

I Made My Decision, What’s Next?
Game programming is vastly different from any other kind of programming. Some of its good parts come from the cutting edge challenges you can come across, as well as the satisfaction of seeing your name run across the credit screen. Furthermore
It’s also very fun whenever I start a new project. When I have to allow everything in my libraries to be refreshed and rewritten. Though being fair, as game development is notorious for harsh deadlines
Rather than simply working mind-numbing plain programming jobs until you rack up an impressive resume- work on a passion project. It needn’t be much; it doesn’t have to have the most cutting edge graphics or even be all that good of a game. What clients want to see is that you can make games, not that you can simply code.
Animators and programmers tend to have quite an intense relationship as well. Think about it like a balancing act on a rope. The animator needs to ensure that the character looks good at doing what they do. On the other hand, the programmer needs to ensure that they look good and feel responsive to the player.
It’s also worth pointing out that the time pressure is quite insane. It’s not rare for game devs to be developing something completely new on a deadline. And by “new” I’m not referring to minor modifications to data structures. I’m talking more about applying theoretical designs for the first time. For example, when looking at Ultima VII
Your first project might not force you to crunch, maybe the second won’t either
This included some basic essentials such as a 2D vector animation program. These 5 weeks felt to me more like 15. While the development team was tiny, we all worked up until late into the evening and then dragged ourselves back into office by the next morning. Weekends were a forgotten concept. We probably ground ourselves with 90-100 hour workweeks for that week.
The schedules at Origin Systems were so hellish that the teams wound up building bunk beds within their company kitchens. Unfortunately, the office of yours truly was found straight across the hall. I was able to see the kitchen and bedroom combo house more people than the local homeless shelter- and these were all well-paid programmers.
In the Origin development team, we soon learned the menu at Jason’s Deli by heart. I know parts of the menu even today
There’s a weird thing about the way humans work. When we experience something that left us terrified, or if we have a really painful experience
This is another obvious difference. A big team will need a lot of money to be funded successfully because there are a lot more people that the company needs to pay. In turn, this also means that games that are made by AAA studios usually have significantly higher development costs.
Indie developers usually ditch the whole market research aspect. They are usually simply passion projects, and will not shy away from a niche design
I Made My Decision, What’s Next?
You’ll always find people pushing you to learn a statically typed language such as C++ or similar in game development. Saying how they’re the best and that while they may have a steep “learning curve” once you get the hang of them, you’re set.
A parallel Projection game, a la Chrono Trigger.
The most important issue about implementing everything yourself is that if you aren’t already experienced, chances are you’ll just reimplement a game library that already exists out there. There won’t be much delay before you’ve reached the point of needing an interface to get your graphics in order.
We can get all the graphics that we’re going to use in this project from http://opengameart.org/ . You’ll notice that most of these aren’t quite the cutting edge graphics that you’ll see in most AAA titles. However, you also don’t have to pay for them
The main villain starts wailing on you. All the skills you would’ve had if you were controlling your character are rendered irrelevant as they quickly lose, without you being able to do anything about it.
When I say you should accept criticism, I don’t just mean of the “this game sucks” variety. I mean that you should take the opinions of your players seriously; after all
You’re the person that has sunk in dozens of hours into learning how to make games, only to sink in dozens more into actually making them. This doesn’t make for the most impartial of observers. Ideally
If there’s a part of RPG Maker that you want to change, then chances are you’ll be able to do that through the Ruby programming language. This can also be done in real-time
While having a steep learning curve is fine, most players that see this will simply walk away. An easier approach to take is to introduce new mechanics and stats slowly as the player progresses through the game.
Darkest Dungeon equips every character with 4 distinct moves that can deal either damage or stress. If a heroes’ stress gauge hits 200, they suffer a heart attack
Every decision is meaningful, where you’ll place a hero which skills you’ll equip
Your mistakes and victories also tend to be obvious; the in-game narrator tends to point out mistakes and bad decisions. For example, pursuing great rewards by turning off the light mid-dungeon
It has enough determinism that a skilled player will almost always be able to clear the game. There are countless speedruns out there, as well as challenge runs such as “no light” and similar. This is the hallmark of a well-designed game.
The Hardcore: These folks want their challenges and they want it now. They are much less interested in the progression than they are in the intrinsic challenge of your game. Sure, they might like the story
The Mathematician: These gamers want to be crunching numbers all day long. They want to be able to draw up graphs and theorycraft their build so they can fully optimize their character. They aren’t so much in it for the challenge, as they like big numbers popping up on their screen. They aren’t averse to grinding XP to help themselves improve.
You don’t need to make too many changes to your game in order to include post-game content, and it can really help your game get and retain players.
From there on you should signpost most of the important decisions for the player. This way, you avoid the most fundamental issue with adventure puzzle games.
● Project- This contains every file within your project. If you just drag-and-drop files from Explorer into the window, Unity will add them to the currently open project.
Your scene files are where you’ll find lots of the metadata within your game. This means that every little resource you put in there will have its metadata stored there. In general, it’s a great idea to save any scenes you were editing before you leave Unity
● The Assets Folder: This folder will contain essentially every file you put into your project. This includes all the art, audio
I’ll start by pressing on the Project window and making a new C# script. It will be titled Enemy-INT. In order to put this script up to an object, all we need to do is drag the file where we have the script to the object
The game's goal will be for the protagonist to get to 100 points without the enemies catching up to him. Whenever they get a point sphere, their points should go up by 10.
Nor does this book contain everything you need to know about AutoHotkey. Rather it is a continuation of the learning process which started with A Beginner's Guide to AutoHotkey. If you are brand new to AutoHotkey and script writing then you may want to start with that book. If you already know the basics, then you may find this book worthwhile for the additional ideas and techniques it offers. If you're a more experienced programmer
The goal of this book is to help the novice and intermediate script writer become more familiar with AutoHotkey and programming. The more someone understands the nuances of a scripting language, the easier it is to write simple applications. While the AutoHotkey Command listing on the Web technically gives you everything that you need to write a script
There are a number of ways to remap Windows keyboard keys. Some of the early ways involved Windows Registry hacks. There is a program which makes the Registry changes a little easier called Sharpkeys. The program looks to be about six years old and I've never used it, but it should work with Windows 7 (I'm guessing). This is yet another problem which can be quickly solved with AutoHotkey.
To be a code writer you need the proper attitude. The average person doesn't know that programming is as creative a process as any of the arts and more inventive than most technical disciplines. There are many ways to get the job done. It's just that some solutions are more elegant than others. The object is to travel the path that will attain that goal. There may be many curves and a few dead-ends, but there is always a way to get there. The novice programmer needs to be aware of the frustrations associated with writing a script and develop the proper mindset for success. When armed with the knowledge and confidence to undertake the journey
New programmers also should understand that there is no such thing as a perfect program. In most cases there are many different ways of coding the same thing. The goal is to write code that works. It may not be pretty, but if it gets the result
"Most of us who work with computers have had the frustrating experience of ""losing"" an open window off the edges of the screen. It can sometimes be a real challenge to get the window back into the viewing frame. It would be useful to have an AutoHotkey script that when activated would display a list of the currently open windows", then upon selecting one
Change the System Tray icon, Chapter Twenty-two
"If you click the ""Change Icon..."" button", a window will open displaying the icons included within that program (see Figure 3). The path to the icons will be the same or similar to the program path
"Figure 3. The icons associated with an application are found by clicking the ""Change Icon..."" button in the Properties window. When used in an AutoHotkey routine the icons are designated based upon their location in this window as shown (Icon1", Icon2
One difference between this pop-up launch window and the Windows Start Menu or Taskbar is there is no icon or background change when you hover over a button with the cursor. If this is something you want then you can replace Text with the Button control (see Figure 5). The Button control will change color when the mouse hovers over the button. However, the Font control doesn't affect the color of the text in the button which will remain black.
I like the Favorite Links section of the navigation pane of Windows File Explorer which was first introduced with Windows Vista. (Note: The name Windows Explorer was changed to File Explorer in Windows 8. To save (or cause) confusion I use the term Windows File Explorer which opens with +E in all versions of Windows.) I slip my key editorial folders in and out of Favorite Links every week. However, it is fairly limited in space and only available when Windows File Explorer is open. What if there was an easy to access dropdown menu similar to the Windows' right-click menu which is always available
This is where I could have completely eliminated the ELSE portion of the conditional by setting the label on the first MENU statement to FolderHandler. Then that MENU statement would only need to be changed if files are found in the category folder, thus turning it into a submenu. Of course
I hadn't considered the fact that many people don't have a Windows key on their keyboard. My purpose in writing these apps is to use them as tools for learning how to write and use AutoHotkey scripts. Therefore, rather than merely making changes to the apps
Notice that Tray is used in place of the menu name. Tray always refers to the System Tray icon for the current AutoHotkey script. The Icon parameter is used to change the icon displayed. In this case it is icon number 43 found in the Windows System file SHELL32.dll. Later, when the file is compiled with the separate utility (discussed below)
"The second line of code noted merely changes the tool tip message to ""Right-click for QuickLinks", as shown in Figure 1.
"Now whenever someone wants to use ""athleticism"" it is automatically changed to"" athletic ability."" Too bad this doesn't work when the announcers are talking on air. I wanted to change it to"," ""It's 'athletic ability' you airhead!"
"I've also added a line to change ""on accident"" to ""on purpose"" since the former is obviously a Freudian slip used by people trying to hide the truth. Otherwise"," they would say ""by accident"" just like innocent people do. It turns out that ""on accident"" is commonly used by people under 35 while ""by accident"" is used by more mature individuals. Some put the blame on Barney and Friends"
To make any of these changes, install AutoHotkey and update the original AutoCorrect.ahk. Then you can either run the AHK file with the installed software or you can recompile it into the AutoCorrect.exe program which will run on any Windows computer.
If for some reason AutoCorrect is changing something you don't want changed, you can usually correct it by temporarily leaving out the space or punctuation at the end of the word (the correction won't activate)
"I've added the AutoCorrect app to all my computers. It impresses me when I see the typo ""thier"" change to ""their"" right before my eyes—regardless of which program or Web page I'm using. If you need to add a number of special characters to your keyboard", then it may be better to add them to the AutoCorrect.ahk file in a manner that makes them easy to remember.

"Note that 86400000 microseconds (24 hours) have been added to NewTime. Plus the FormatTime is changed to reflect only the hour and minutes with AM or PM.

"Team of developers: For the ""team of developers"," Rust shows to be really handy. Low-level programming code has defects that must be thoroughly tested by testers. In the case of Rust, however, the compiler refuses to compile the code if it includes flaws. By working in parallel with the compiler, the developer may concentrate on the logic of the programme rather than on the bugs.

Students: o Many people can learn how to construct an operating system using Rust. The Rust team is attempting to make system principles more approachable to non-programmers, particularly those who are new to the field.

Companies: Rust is used by both large and small businesses to complete diverse jobs. Command-line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrency, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine learning, and even large portions of the Firefox web browser are among these activities.

Open source developers: Rust is an open source language, which means that the source code is freely available. As a result, they can use the source code to improve Rust's design.





Features of Rust


Rust is a programming language for systems. Rust has the following characteristics:

Zero cost abstraction

Error messages

Move semantics

Threads without data races

Pattern matching

Guaranteed memory safety

Efficient C bindings

Safe memory space allocation

Minimal time





1. Zero cost abstraction


We can add abstractions to Rust programming without compromising its runtime performance. It increases the clarity and quality of the code without sacrificing runtime efficiency.





2. Error messages


When compared to GCC, the error messages in C++ programming are vastly improved. In terms of clarity, Rust takes it a step farther. In our programme, error messages are presented with (formatting, colours) and also propose misspellings.





3. Type inference


Rust has a Type inference feature, which means it automatically detects the type of an expression.





4. Move semantics


When a source object is a temporary object, Rust provides this functionality that allows a copy action to be replaced by a move operation.





5. Threads without data races


A data race occurs when two or more threads access the same memory address at the same time. Because of the ownership mechanism in Rust, threads can run without data races. Only the owners of separate objects are sent to various threads via the ownership mechanism, and two threads can never own the same variable with write access.





6. Pattern matching


The pattern matching feature is available in Rust. Pattern matching in Rust uses patterns in conjunction with the'match' expressions to provide the programmer additional control over the control flow of the programme. The following are some pattern combinations:

Literals

Arrays, enums, structs, or tuples

Variables

Wildcards

Placeholders





7. Guaranteed memory safety


Rust used the concept of ownership to ensure memory safety. Ownership is a compromise between C's memory control and Java's garbage collection. Variables own memory space in Rust applications, which is temporarily borrowed by other variables. This allows Rust to offer memory safety without relying on the garbage collector at compile time.





8. Efficient C bindings


The feature of 'Efficient C bindings' in Rust means that the Rust language can communicate with the C language in the same way that it communicates with itself. Rust provides a 'foreign function interface' for interacting with C APIs while also leveraging its ownership structure to ensure memory safety.





9. Safe memory space allocation


Memory management in Rust is manual, which means that the programmer has explicit control over where and when memory is allocated and released. In C, we use the malloc function to allocate memory and subsequently initialise it, while Rust refuses to do both with a single  operator. The smart pointer to int is returned by this operator. A smart pointer is a type of value that determines when an item is released. Smart pointers are ""smart"" because they can not only track the location of an object but also clean it up."
Stack memory is a type of memory that is well-organized. Because of the way it accesses memory, it is faster than heap memory.

An object is a reference. There are two sorts of references: changeable and immutable references. Irreversible references are copied, while changeable references are relocated.
dence. The two subjects are closely related and are here treated together. The purpose of the treatise is to describe fully the parts of English speech and their changes of form to express thought. The word ‘form’ does not mean today what it did in the Old Eng­ lish period. It was then associated with the idea of a change of endings to express thought. Most of the old endings have disap­ peared. The old syntactical framework remains intact, but the grammatical forms
We often simply use an intransitive as a transitive causative without a change of form, in accordance with the common English principle of using the same form as an intransitive or a transitive: ‘The horse swam (intrans.) across the river? ‘He swam (trans

strongly stressed element, usually an adverb
an adverb or adverbial element usually precedes the modified word: ‘She is very pretty.’ ‘She sings very beautifully.’ An ad­ verb that modifies a verb precedes the verb if it itself has a weaker stress but follows the verb if it itself has the stronger stress: ‘It’s too bad! I utterly forgot it.’ ‘He acted promptly.’ After the anal­ ogy of ‘She would utterly forgtt her past’ many people say, ‘She wishes to utterly forget her past.’ They feel that the adverb should stand before the more heavily stressed verb. Others think that the second sentence is incorrect

sitional object is common after an accusative object: ‘He wrote a book on his experiences in the war.’ The noun in this preposi­ tional object is often an infinitive: ‘His father forced him to make his own living.’ ‘I persuaded him to do it.’ ‘I can’t bring myself to speak to him about it.’ ‘I will leave you to imagine my embar­ rassment.’ The to of the infinitive in these examples is not a mere sign of the infinitive but a real preposition governing the following infinitive, which is here still a verbal noun although it now takes an accusative object.

They were randomly approached according to two main criteria: (i) they had to be teaching English language in a university and (ii) they should have experienced being in lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis for at least 2 weeks when answering the first questionnaire. Some of them were authors’ contacts and others were approached by some colleagues. They were informed about the aim of the research and voluntarily accepted to participate and to share their personal data, which have been kept undisclosed.

It opened an entirely new world of possibilities that could be effectively used in the future. Second
Although I feel like I’ve gained some experience in teaching online, I do think that ‘on campus’ teaching works better for language classes/workshops because of the face-to-face interaction and informality. (2BP33)
When asked if they changed their methodology of teaching, 24 in Q1 and 23 teachers in Q2 (55.8% and 65.7%
Q2 was more specific about methodology changes and the responses indicated that teachers adapted (77%, n = 27) and created (60%
[I use digital tools] very differently depending on the task and the intended learning outcome. But in general, I use them to mimic something I might want to achieve in a f2f session. So
As for the consequences of the changes due to COVID-19 on language teaching, Q2 respondents highlighted some negative aspects such as lack of socialisation and group cohesion among students (48.6%
Teachers were asked in both questionnaires about the digital resources they were using in their emergency remote English language teaching. Concerning platforms, Moodle was clearly predominant in the first period (35%
Regarding the teachers’ experiences in the use of CMS and online lecturing tools, one of the lecturers surveyed explained how they used the Moodle platform.
The results revealed a twofold perspective on the experience teachers lived through, which is clearly reflected in their responses shown in Sect. 3.2. On the one hand
COVID-19 does not seem to have brought a change in methodology in the English language subjects. The main reasons appear to be the temporality of the situation, accompanied by the lack of time to prepare the materials
This unexpected and disruptive situation has left universities in a better position to develop blended and online learning in the future, as Adell and Castañeda (2012) predicted
This study has been developed as part of the research project funded by the Research Promotion Plan at Universitat Jaume I (Spain), grant ID: UJI-B2020-09.
It is evident that teaching and learning under such difficult circumstances is challenging and requires creative thinking and a problem-solving mindset. This contrasts with planned online education courses, which are carefully and methodically designed by groups of professionals.
Mishra (2019) adds flexibility to the framework by including the variable of context. This places emphasis on teachers’ knowledge and experience of working within the constraints of a particular structure, organization
The COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as a catalyst for encouraging expertise and creativity among both experienced and newly qualified teachers. These teachers have been forced by circumstances into a sudden transition from a face-to-face to an ERT environment, regardless of their experience or competence in using technology and regardless of any external barriers that may exist
In terms of recalibrating professional development for language and other teachers, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic world
In terms of the presentation of the data in the next section: questionnaire participants are coded as ‘P1’ for questionnaire participant 1, then ‘P2’
Participants actively sought resources and support from a wide range of sources for teaching English languages classes online. Resources including webinars, in some cases these being compulsory (P-C)
Another factor in terms of enhancing learning within a particular setting is the availability of mobile phones, laptops
There were a number of participants in this study who seemed to have adapted reasonably well to ERT in an online environment. These participants came across as highly motivated to spend considerable amounts of time preparing their classes and had often engaged in professional development, both via online events and through personal exploration. They seemed to possess the ‘can do’ attitude described in Balchin and Wild (2015) and to seek out ways to make things work
Briefly summarise the context of your online teaching experience in the past year (e.g., education level
What challenges have you experienced when teaching online – technical, administrative and/or pedagogical?
Even in situations where online learning is a carefully planned and anticipated part of a study program, the move from face-to-face classrooms to computer-mediated communication environments necessitates a significant role adjustment and instigates a wide array of emotions on the part of students. The coronavirus pandemic presented a unique opportunity to take stock of students’ experiences in light of a rapid transition to unknown modes and practices
In the move from face-to-face (F2F) classroom experiences to computer-mediated communication environments, students undergo a significant role adjustment (Cleveland-Innes et al.
The process of adjustment to an online learning (OL) environment as well as the emotions experienced by first-time online learners have mostly been investigated in situations where OL has been methodically planned. Moreover, students (and teachers) tend to have either proactively chosen to undertake their studies (or teaching) online
Another core difference between planned and EOL resides in the availability and ability of role models (i.e. teachers and peers experienced in OL) to support novice online learners during the transition process. In the initial period of adjusting to an OL environment, students often “grapple with requirements
Much of the important emerging research on students’ (emotional) experiences of the COVID-19-induced transition to OL has either gathered data from large-scale, quantitative studies using Likert-scale or tick-box questions (e.g. Besser et al.
Role adjustment is necessitated by the differences in activities and modes of communication in a new environment (Cleveland-Innes et al., 2007
Cleveland-Innes et al.’s (2007) study found that first-time online learners were able to articulate their adjustment process from F2F classes to AOL in answers to open-ended questions. Five themes arose in the analysis: interaction (quantity and value of written communication with teachers and peers), self-identity (increased responsibility for learning); instructor role (visibility and feedback); course design (effectiveness of course structure and delivery); and technology (issues). Furthermore
SOL is implemented through teleconferencing media. Many options for communication exist; audio and video can be set to be one-way (the teacher is heard and seen by the students) or two-way (teachers and students can both hear and see each other), with both conditions usually enabling text-based chat. In synchronous communication environments
Learning in synchronous online classes has been shown to touch on students’ emotions. When reflecting on his experience of facilitating online chat activities, Ng (2004
A central reason why a thoughtful consideration and further exploration of emotions is of great magnitude is because emotions can generate subsequent actions which “may range from a determination to invest mental energy in the learning process to the adoption of coping strategies to protect well-being and survive the challenge” (Wosnitza & Volet, 2005
Although the current study was not explicitly designed to investigate language learning in online settings, it was deemed important to situate it within a foreign language learning context because such classrooms are notorious for negative emotions. In Resnik and Dewaele’s (2021) research undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic which compared language students’ perceptions of EOL and F2F classes
Students’ responses to the first five of a total of 11 open-ended reflection questions comprise the data for this study:When you found out that learning would take place online, what were your first thoughts and/or emotions?
Interest: “I was eager to discover new ways of learning.”; “I was curious to see how online learning would play out, since I feel like some classes could perfectly be given online.”
Pride: “Also for speaking skills, working in the small groups really gave me the feeling I was making some progress.”
The primary aim of this study was to explore students’ adjustment to the role of online learner in an EOL context and to identify the emotions associated with specific areas of adjustment. By examining the experiences that students expressed in their responses to reflection questions, we were able to better understand which areas signaled the most significant adjustments (i.e. aspects which students emphasized). We were also able to see which adjustments induced either positive or negative emotions
All 40 students depicted several role adjustment experiences in their responses, with the representative examples in the sections below being reported as verbatim. A total of 293 comments relating to the adjustment process were identified
Another sub-theme mentioned by 4 students was their observation of teachers adapting to the OL setting. One particularly interesting comment hinted at the uncertainty caused by not having an experienced role model to follow in a new learning environment; “it was weird because the professors also didn’t really know what to do”. Students’ perceptions of teacher confidence with the pandemic-induced transition to OL are important because they have been found to positively predict factors such as enjoyment, interest
Other areas of adjustment included learning in a different physical environment (mentioned by 9 students in mostly positive comments such as being “happy to be able to go home” and feeling “comfortable”), not commuting (mentioned by 8 students in mostly positive comments and often consequently linked to “feeling more rested” and it being “easier to focus on classes”)
This study sheds light on the experiences of 40 higher education EFL students in Belgium who, like millions of students around the world

SELF (autonomous learning: discipline, staying focused)
and I think most professors also became comfortable with online learning, which helped a lot
The transition to online learning was difficult, because of all the chaos. We had many courses to keep up with and many professors tried to communicate with us about certain assignments and classes on Ufora. However
I don’t think the experience was too bad all together, it just demanded a lot of discipline.
The last thing I liked about online learning was the fact that I was at home, and could for example take a break by going for a walk
The present study draws from the need to face twenty-first-century Engineering students’ lack of oral communication skills in digital environments. The existing deficiencies became evident during the months of COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, when most communication processes
University graduates seeking employment in the engineering area of multinational corporations face the challenge of standing out in a highly competitive job market. Among the primary skills they must command are communication, teamwork
The lack of communication skills among engineering students is also evident in digital oral communication. The existing deficiencies have become especially visible during lockdown months, when most of the communication processes
The paradigm shift in communication was especially evident during the COVID-19 lockdown, when most communication processes were digital. Recent studies claim that the proliferation of digital oral communication is reshaping the quality and quantity of face-to-face communication
One of the most recent attempts to develop an oracy skills framework was undertaken by Neil Mercer, Paul Warwick and Ayesha Ahmed in 2014. They identified the skills needed to communicate effectively
Building communication skills focuses on five content and cognition elements: audience, content
The extraordinary situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic gave us the opportunity to collect our students’ perceptions of their command of oral skills in digital environments as 100% of our communication activities were online. This was not the case before the pandemic when all our teaching practice was face-to-face. Drawing on a challenge-based learning methodology (Fidalgo et al., 2017; Nichols et al.
To examine students’ perceptions of their command of digital oral skills in ESP context, a case study was carried out with a group of 76 students from the Higher Technical School of Computer Engineering of the UPM who were enrolled in the English for Professional and Academic Communication subject
To explore our students’ perceptions about their command of digital oral skills, we developed a self-assessment sheet for them to evaluate their ability to communicate in digital video environments: video pitches and video presentations (see Appendix A).
Fig. 2Scoring criteria for grading digital oral skills. (Bobkina & Domínguez, 2020)
Building communication skills achieved the highest number of positive responses (Table 3): 84.2% (N = 64) of the respondents rated their command as average or high compared to 15.8% (N = 12), who described it as low. However
Within the group of building communication skills, the linguistic area was the most negatively affected. As shown in Table 4
Regarding performing communication skills, essential deficiencies stand out both in the physical (non-verbal language) and socio-emotional areas (interaction
To complete the information retrieved from the quantitative analysis and further explore our students’ perceptions of their command of digital oral skills, we developed a self-assessment sheet based on our theoretical framework for research on digital oracy skills followed in the self-assessment sheet (Bobkina & Domínguez
The qualitative data resulting from their responses were analysed using three main codes from the framework’s main areas: building communication skills, performing communication skills and creating digital content skills (Fig. 2). These comprise further sub-categories also shown in Fig. 2: content/cognition and linguistic area
‘I think that the presentation and the concepts that we expose are arranged in a clear way. The slides show both information and images about the project. We believe that the last slide with some of the sources provides credibility and information, not only in the presentation but also the one that has more interest afterwards.’
‘My main strength in this project is that i had made some other videos previously, uploaded on platforms that thousands of people watched and i am used to talking in front of many people’.
‘Another weak point could be that when trying to summarize so that the presentation was concise and that we did not digress into things that were not important, it is possible that I have been a little short when explaining it’.
‘In the presentation, I think that I could have better unified the two slides
‘My main weakness on this oral presentation are the resources that I have in my actual house to record and edit the video, without my usual computer I have done my best to record and upload to a platform to share’.
The study was undertaken in the belief that it could help better understand the ESP Engineering university students’ needs when communicating in digital oral environments through the analysis of students’ perceptions about their command of digital oral skills. Digital settings for oral communication are gradually becoming more generalised in the modern labour market. Their relevance as an essential element in current engineering education can hardly be overestimated (Bejaković & Mrnjavac, 2020; Minh et al.
The study results reveal that digital oral communication is a pending subject for almost 21% of the respondents who described their level of command as low or inadequate. Regarding the skills involved in communication, difficulties were detected at all three stages of language communication: building
Building up communication skills was described by most students as the least troublesome area, especially when it comes to cognition and content. These results could be explained by students’ broad experience in organising and presenting information during their academic years. On the contrary
Regarding performing communication skills, essential difficulties were detected in approximately 22
When dealing with the socio-emotional aspects of communication, lack of self-confidence and speaking anxiety are the two most common problems described by around 20% of the surveyed students. In particular
The pedagogical implications of the study point to the need for an emphasis on digital communication in both professional and academic contexts, preparing students for the new communication reality that is led by technology. Teachers should consider using video recordings and presentations as effective tools to prepare students for twenty-first-century communication. They should incorporate different techniques and activities that would be beneficial to them for developing skills related to digital communication
Council of Europe. (2001). Common European framework of reference for languages: Learning, teaching
Language MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been identified as an emergent and expanding field of research. They represent an innovative educational proposal that emphasizes the open and social side of language learning in digital environments. This chapter offers an overview of the state of the art in the field, with distinct parts. First
In the context of language learning (LL), the debate regarding whether MOOCs are good quality and effective learning environments has become even more contentious
This chapter provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in Language MOOC (LMOOC) research with a special focus on English learning. In fact, English language MOOCs are not only the ones most widely offered
The concept of open education was in its origin very much linked to the appearance of The Open University in Britain (1969) – which claimed that access to education and educational resources should be viable and free for all-and removing the access requirements that universities normally have. This concept gradually evolved (Weller, 2012) and nowadays open education is more identified with online teaching and digital resources that are offered openly
Revise: the right to adapt, adjust
OERs have a great potential for the teaching and learning of foreign languages (Beaven et al., 2013; Comas-Quinn et al.
Sokolik (2014) goes further down this line and provides some recommendations for social learning with LMOOCs specifically: (1) maximize engagement and interaction; (2) facilitate, but do not manage
Despite the criticism, LMOOCs are on the rise. The pandemic has boosted the interest in online learning and led to what Shah (2020) has called ‘The Second Year of the MOOC’. Back in 2012
Attempts to overcome the xMOOC/cMOOC dichotomy and find the model that is most suitable for language teaching and learning. Some authors even argue that a blended modality, combining LMOOCs and face-to-face classes is the ideal method for optimal language learning.
Reflection on the new role of the teacher in LMOOCs. The source of knowledge is not the instructor -who acts as a facilitator- but the open resources available in the LMOOC, and this creates a new balance between teacher and student.
Importance of social learning in LMOOCs, and how this has to be further explored
LMOOCs focusing on certain skills: These are devoted to specific aspects of LL which pose special difficulty for EFL/ESL learners, such as “Conversational English skills” by Tsinghua University on edX6 or “The pronunciation of American English” by the University of California
Tandem LMOOCs combining L1 and L2: These courses adopt an eTandem learning approach, in which “pairs of learners who are native or near-native speakers of each other’s target languages collaborate to learn each other’s language” (Appel & Pujolà
MOOCs on English Medium instruction (EMI) and CLIL (Content and language integrated learning): In the past decades there has been a growing demand for learning contexts in which subjects are taught in a foreign language -often English- with the double aim of learning simultaneously the content of the subject and the foreign language. CLIL is usually followed in Primary and Secondary Education, while EMI has been adopted by many HEIs. In line with this trend
MOOCs on LL methodology: Both this final category and the previous one are devoted to EFL/ESL professionals who wish to keep up to date with English teaching and learning methodologies. Some examples of MOOCs catering for these needs are “TESOL strategies: Supporting ESL students in Mainstream Classrooms” by the University of Glasgow on FutureLearn16 or “TESOL methodology” by University of Maryland, Baltimore county.17
The second most accessed learning object in LMOOCs is textual resources (Martín-Monje et al., 2018). These resources can be included as core content
There seems to be agreement that a powerful set of communication tools is one of the defining features of successful LMOOCs (Sallam, 2020)
This chapter has outlined the main advancements in the field of LMOOC research for English teaching and learning, providing an insight into its theoretical foundations
LMOOCs represent an innovative educational initiative in the online EFL/ESL learning scenario, with novel proposals for content delivery (giving prominence to audio-visual resources)
Textual resources are also relevant, but they tend to be used as downloadable support materials
A powerful set of communication tools is essential in an LMOOC. Forums are the main means of interaction, but some courses include videoconferences
The inclusion of some learning strategies in the LMOOC has a positive effect on the LL process, so it should be further explored and implemented by course designers.
The chapter describes a model for the design and implementation of oral communicative tasks. This task-based language teaching model connects asynchronous and synchronous online language instruction to foster language learning (with a focus on oral communication) through incremental task progressions. The model grew out of professional development innovations and years of pre-pandemic online and remote teaching practices at a large U.S. university. What sets our model apart is the purposeful scaffolding of a series of thematically and linguistically related interactive tasks, enabling students to develop the skills and confidence necessary to engage productively in the core interpersonal task. Specifically
are goal oriented. There is a goal and communicative purpose to the task itself that requires negotiation and an open outcome that can be reported back, and not just the display of rehearsed language.
are opportunities for reflective learning. Through its experiential and open nature, the task affords learners opportunities for reflective learning.
Students describe their family members’ and/or friends’ interests. The goal is to practice certain structures (she likes/dislikes; her hobby is...) and vocabulary (family relations, hobbies)
One key feature of this instructional design model is its carefully sequenced interplay between the synchronous and asynchronous modalities and the different ACTFL modes of communication (See Table 2). Specifically, the core interpersonal synchronous task in our model is bookended by two related asynchronous presentational tasks. The preceding task is both thematically and linguistically linked to the core task
2. Preliminary presentational task and peer responses (e.g., asynchronous video discussion tool)
1. Follow-up presentational task and peer response (e.g., asynchronous video discussion tool
Lessons do not exist in a vacuum but are delivered in a sequence within the context of larger curricular units. Our example lesson is no exception. While this task series centers on oral communicative tasks and does not explicitly dictate what types of initial language learning might need to precede it, the nature of the oral tasks assumes that students come to the task with some background knowledge and language. The cornerstone synchronous task of this lesson
(CLO 1: Presentational) I can express my preferences on familiar and everyday topics of interest, using simple sentences most of the time.
Updated resources should be posted to the interactive session document available to students, including in it any relevant content from the saved chat log from the synchronous session. Links to the follow-up asynchronous video discussion task
The instructor prepares and shares a delayed feedback video that has a language focus (Willis, 1998
For instructors whose classroom format changes semester to semester, the Model for Scaffolded Technology-Enhanced Oral Communicative Tasks offers an easy adaptation to other modalities. With almost no alterations
This chapter describes a task-based model for the design and implementation of oral tasks that is designed to help language instructors scaffold instruction by capitalizing on the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous modes. Synchronous sessions continue to be an essential part of language teaching and learning, and using a model such as ours can help practitioners continue to center their instruction around synchronous interactions without relying solely on what is afforded by the synchronous mode. By properly sequencing synchronous and asynchronous modes
Online assessment practices have been affected by various factors ranging from teachers’ technological competence to devices and tools offered and made available both to teachers and students. The current study aimed at exploring challenges and issues experienced by language lecturers in Turkish tertiary contexts during their transition to online/distance learning and teaching. The participants of the study included seventy-five language lecturers at the School of Foreign Languages and the Department of Foreign Language Education at various state universities in Turkey. The study used quantitative data provided by the participants’ responses to the online survey which included several short-answer questions regarding how they assessed students during the pandemic. The survey was created through Google Forms and shared with the participants via emails and social networking sites. The major results of the study indicated that a great majority of the participants did not have any power in the selection of the assessment types as the university senates determined the main assessment to be assignments or projects. The results also showed that academic integrity and grading were other concerns during the online assessment, in addition to technical problems
Much has been discussed about the importance of assessment and also the influence of technology in enhancing learning and teaching practices (Ferdig et al., 2020; Ferdig & Pytash
Assessment is an indispensable part of learning and teaching practices, and language learning is not an exception to this
Learners can be provided with resources in and outside the classroom by using the available tools and websites on the Internet (Gimeno-Sanz et al., 2014; Lomicka & Lord
As for the changes introduced into the existing language tests, Wagner and Krylova (2021) investigated how an oral communication test was moved online at Temple University. Rather than moving the test online
Ockey et al. (2021) indicated that Iowa State University decided to hold the placement test of oral communication face-to-face with strict limitations regarding health safety measures. This face-to-face decision was due to several limitations, but mainly security issues regarding determining the test taker’s identity and the limitations of technology. Zhang et al. (2021) investigated Chinese EFL teachers’ practices in online assessment practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and collected data through semi-structured retrospective interviews. The results indicated that teachers introduced several changes to their assessment practices
Mahapatra (2021) explored online formative assessment and feedback practices of three ESLT teachers that work in tertiary education in Nepal, Bangladesh
The study benefited from qualitative data through online surveys through which the participants responded to several short-answer questions regarding how they assessed their students in the courses offered during the pandemic and the opportunities and challenges faced during this process. The survey was created through Google Forms and shared with the participants through emails and social networking sites such as Facebook at the end of the Spring Semester in June 2021, and the responses were collected for 3 weeks.
As my university required all the lecturers to use assignments or projects for the midterms and finals, I prepared several tasks which would require the students to do some research on the topic and synthesize what they obtained. I tried to ask questions or creates tasks that would not lead them to copy and paste the information from the internet.
Assessing the speaking skill is a really challenging task during online assessment. As there were many students in my class, it was not possible to practice speaking. In my classes
Academic integrity was another challenge of online assessment since many participants (n = 64) expressed that as there were no precautions taken against cheating during the online exams and it was not possible to determine the authorship of the assignments and projects submitted. Regarding this, one participant expressed that:It is not possible to avoid cheating or prevent students from getting others to do the work. This is a genuine concern if there are no precautions taken about the security of the exam. It was really difficult to know who was the actual author of the assignment submitted [Participant ID7].
Grading exams was another issue indicated by most of the participants (n = 60). It was stated that as some universities required final exams to be conducted as the assignments and/or projects, and many classes were overcrowded
Related to grading essays and projects, several participants (n = 23) expressed that in addition to the hours spent in front of the screen before and during online teaching
Assessment is an indispensable part of any teaching and learning context, and language learning practices are not an exception to this. Assessment practices have been crucial in tertiary education
This chapter is the significantly improved version of the presentation published as an abstract in the Book of abstracts- The 10th conference on linguistic and intercultural education- CLIE 2020, 1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba Iulia
Advances in global awareness and attention to diverse populations have led to an increased need for educators to learn how to serve diverse students. Accelerated by the recent shift to online instruction and assessment to support students’ learning during the COVID-19 pandemic; educators face an unprecedented imperative to move instruction online and still meet the needs of all learners. In this chapter, I discuss the need for equitable online instruction and make explicit that equitable online instruction is beneficial for all learners
Connecting these critical points in practice to support language learning is imperative to providing equitable access for all learners. While previous research has focused on the cognitive considerations for language learning and identified connections to high incidence disabilities, like reading disabilities (i.e.
Representation – Presenting information to students in multiple ways to provide opportunities for understanding the learning targets and what to do, and
Engagement refers to the act of motivating students to participate in the instruction and learning process. This means that the more students are interested or motivated in the instruction, they might be more likely to pay attention
Referring to the hypothetical class activity and academic language goals, educators should incorporate multiple strategies such as increasing students’ time on task (i.e.
Three main guidelines also support the representation principle. This refers to building in multiple representations to present information in a variety of ways (i.e., multimodal) and building in options for individualized interaction with the content (refer to Guideline 1: Provide Options for Perception
Understanding learners’ needs beyond what they need to know from an English language instructional standpoint can be a complex endeavor. Some helpful examples of these approaches in the literature and practice are represented in the Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit. The Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit is a free resource (at the time of writing this) that introduces three key concepts. First, that needs emerge across all learners
Each of these time-bound conditions can introduce challenges for learners and how they experience English language instruction. Ranging from some minor inconveniences to more prevalent and profound impact, each can impact opportunity to learn. As a result
Possible limit of visual access and demonstration of certain skills, e.g.
Construct definition and selected representation and action & expression challenges across language skills, e.g.
 Learning to read (read aloud, decoding) v. reading to learn (comprehension) and accommodations (e.g.
Another challenge implied in the earlier discipline-specific academic language example is the lack of an existing off-the-shelf curriculum that is accessible for the full range of learners. Although in our earlier example, building a graph and using academic language to describe the graph was the learning target
While previous research has explored the connections between language learning and cognitive disabilities (i.e., reading disability; dyslexia)

This chapter reports on a Flipped Teaching experience combining content delivery by means of a tailor-made Massive Open Online Language Course (LMOOC) and in-depth classroom tuition through a Debate project for learners of English for Specific Purposes (ESP). Surveys were administered at the outset and at the end of each of these two teaching methods, as well as a questionnaire enquiring about the flipped classroom approach implemented. The pre-course surveys served the purpose of exploring learners’ expectations
According to the Flipped Learning Network (2014, n.p.)
Although a language learning classroom can be flipped in many ways, the model described in this chapter relies on content delivery through a Massive Open Online Language Course (LMOOC) designed for upper-intermediate learners of English as a foreign language and on a Debate project.
The LMOOC supported autonomous learning with video recorded micro lessons dealing with theoretical concepts (i.e., grammar explanations and use of language) which were further developed into listening
To elicit how learners foresaw participating in an ESP course based on Flipped Teaching practices that relied on two very different learning scenarios (an LMOOC and a Debate) and to explore what their expectations were and their degree of satisfaction upon course completion, the students were asked to complete two pre- and post-course surveys. One focused on the LMOOC and the other on the Debate project. Lastly
The Flipped Teaching experience described in this chapter was conducted during two consecutive years with two cohorts of third-year Aerospace Engineering students (7 female and 26 male), enrolled on a B2 level ESP (English for Specific Purposes) course at the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)
Using class time to discuss each learning topic in more depth, promoting a learner-centred approach. Encouraging students to be actively involved in knowledge construction.
MOOCs in general are open access online courses designed for self-access learning yet delivered following an academic calendar. Customarily, many of these courses are also available on a self-paced basis after the first calendar iteration. Being self-paced has important implications on learning. As such
All the exercises are automatically assessed by the system except for those designed to practice and reinforce productive skills where learners are requested to deliver open text and speaking activities. One of the assessment modes built into the MOOC platform used2 is based on peer-assessment. This was chosen for all the writing assignments in the course. These were set so that each student would have to assess three written assignments using a specifically designed rubric before they could receive their own evaluation. This type of assessment has the added value of encouraging learners to reflect on their peers’ language errors, question their own errors and
Debating falls under the umbrella of argumentative and persuasive language. It is a form of communication meant to convince an audience that the speaker is correct, using evidence and reason. Because a debate is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic where opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints
Distribution of roles (team in favour, team against
Setting up collaboration tools for each team to share sources of information, documents to support their position and prepare their arguments
Presentation on debate structure, rules
The pre-LMOOC questionnaire consisted of 43 questions divided into 6 sections enquiring about (1) demographics; (2) attitude toward language learning; (3) use of information and communications technologies; (4) expectations toward the course; (5) learning styles and preferences, and (6) prior knowledge about the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe
The pre-course questionnaire was completed by all 33 students. Two quarters of them responded they had previous experience learning English online, either at school or independently (n = 16
Their attitude toward learning English was, overall
A follow-up question enquired about the preferred learning modality for this subject with three options: (a) Self-access learning (learning online without a tutor); (b) Autonomous learning (guided by a tutor), and (c) Blended learning (both combined). Nearly two thirds (60.6%
Providing learners with appropriate feedback after each completed task is central for an adequate progression in language learning (Livingstone, 2012; Nassaji
With regard to the Debate project, only 1 student had prior experience so it was very important to phase the activities that would lead to the live debate and provide appropriate training and practice.
In order to compare how much the learners thought they had improved their language skills and their transversal skills after the Debate project had taken place, we asked them the same questions as in the pre-survey. As shown in Fig. 12
A closer relationship with fellow students (e.g., collaborating on preparing the debate in teams).
In this chapter we set out to determine whether Flipped Teaching could be successfully implemented in a B2 level English language course within the Aerospace Engineering degree at UPV by combining an LMOOC and a Debate project. To gain insight into our students’ attitudes towards this mode of blended learning, sundry surveys were administered to shed light on their degree of satisfaction and draw conclusions as to the reasons leading to that feeling of fulfilment.
In terms of optimizing online English language learning and teaching, this study provides empirical evidence that leads us to believe that an overarching Flipped Teaching methodology combining online instruction and face-to-face language practice is motivating for higher education EFL learners for the following reasons: (a) flipping the class with an LMOOC relieves the teacher from repetitive instruction within the classroom

Education during the COVID-19 pandemic has experienced a massive shift towards online modes of instruction in higher education. This paper presents an example of such adaptation during the spring 2020 lockdown in the context of an ESP course taught to psychology students at a Spanish university. Specifically, we adopted the Cybertask model (Girón-García C.Learning styles and reading modes in the development of language learning autonomy through ‘Cybertasks’. Barcelona. ed. Universitat Jaume I. Retrieved November 7
The combination of CBI (whose focus is placed on the subject matter in the language being learned) with e-learning TBLT in the classroom often boosts a more dynamic pedagogical landscape that becomes particularly engaging for students when it is exploited in Cybertasks (Girón-García & Boghiu-Balaur, 2021). Technology and TBLT provide an appropriate combination that leads to the emergence of Technology-mediated TBLT (González-Lloret
1.2 Digital Learning Tasks: WebQuests, TalenQuests
Learning in an asynchronous virtual environment often involves completing a series of tasks designed by an instructor to make the most of the students’ time. Over the years, there have been many types of digital learning tasks based on TBLT approaches requiring authentic resources from an autonomist perspective
Such learning skills, entrenched in students’ use of online resources enclosed in online task-based models
Acceptance of life difficulties that you cannot change, so that you can learn to cope with them through avoidance strategies
The first research question (RQ1) explored the effectiveness of each pedagogical treatment in terms of potential changes in participants’ knowledge about the contents dealt with in the tasks measured through pre/post-test scores. A repeated-measures ANOVA was run to evaluate the time by group interaction (Table 2) revealing statistically significant effects of instruction (Wilks’ λ = 0.573, F (2.111) = 41.427
This paper has illustrated a case of adaptation to the “online mode” in the framework of the COVID-19 crisis in a Spanish higher education ESP course taught to first-year psychology degree students. Specifically, it has attempted to survey the pedagogical potential and the students’ perceptions of two equivalent online tasks in an asynchronous Moodle Lesson format and in a synchronous live Google Meet session guided by the teacher.
The first research question addressed the potential effectiveness of either pedagogical alternative to deal with task-related content in the FL. Both pedagogical alternatives were found to be similarly effective to help students to deal with content and individual work with online resources in this classroom context, with significant differences compared to the group that did not receive such instruction. Beyond pedagogical potential

Games can be an effective tool in the language-learning classroom to motivate learners, to build rapport
Motivation in the language classroom is often a concern, which is amplified in an online environment where interaction and friendship between students can be more challenging given the lack of physical proximity between participants. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part offers an overview of potential of games for language learning and ends with an examination of the potential of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) as a tool for increasing student motivation and fostering language development in online courses. Not only do games
Language learning can be a challenging endeavor. It requires a great deal of practice with the language, and learners need to feel comfortable and confident enough to experiment with speaking and writing in the language knowing that they will inevitably make mistakes as they work towards improved proficiency. As a result
Feeling motivated and confident to practice the target language is an important psychological component to successful language learning. Goldman and Chen (2013) explored the role of motivation in relation to an interactive computer game that was built to help native Portuguese players learn and practice the target language of English. In this game, players were presented with a series of pirate-themed quests
In addition to helping learners develop linguistic skills, studies suggest that games also help with communication skills. In his account of teaching English in Korea
It is clear that there are many benefits to games and that they can contribute to better language learning and stronger language learners. Yet gaming takes many forms, and not all forms of games are equal. Games for language learning can be categorized into three forms of integration: games in the classroom
The second category of integration is game-based learning. At this level, games become the primary tool for learning
In game-based learning, a game is far more integrated into the teaching and learning experience than it is with the games in the classroom category (deHaan
Recognizing that games for language learning can have remarkable benefits as well as potential problems, educators should be judicious in their choice of games and how well they relate to curricular goals. The following advice may be helpful. First
Games for language learning encompass not only a variety of games but also a range of curricular integration including supplemental activities, deeper games that are core to curricular goals
Games have long played a role in language learning classrooms, and as language learning expands into online contexts
Recognizing that games for language learning can have remarkable benefits as well as potential problems, educators should be judicious in their choice of games and how well they relate to course and program curricular goals. Instructors should select games that offer plenty of linguistic development (deHaan
Farkas shares some important considerations for online language instructors. TTRPGs are excellent opportunities for practicing language because the entire gaming experience is created through oral (or written) communication; the game master and players must describe everything in the game, including all characters and environments. They also have to accurately describe the interactions that players encounter during gameplay
This study suggests the relative ease and limited preparation time required of instructors to integrate TTRPGs into their online language learning courses. Although some TTRPG gameplay can require large amounts of preparation for the game master, a rules light TTRPG
Further research into TTRPGs for language learning might explore the quality of speech production during TTRPG gameplay. For example, how well is the quality of pronunciation and grammar of the players
This chapter summarized the main benefits of game-based learning in the language classroom. The value of games for language learning include student motivation as well as potential increases in learners’ interpersonal communication skills and linguistic proficiency. There are also some challenges to using games in the language learning classroom, so instructors should be prepared to mitigate these issues by selecting games that are best suited to the learners
The benefits of game-based learning extend to online contexts where some games are even better suited to virtual participation, such as TTRPGs. These games involve collaborative storytelling among small groups of players with minimal game materials beyond dice. As such
The unprecedented sanitary emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has had repercussions in almost every aspect of life. Education is not an exception as the pandemic has disrupted regular face-to-face teaching worldwide. Most higher education institutions have been forced to make pedagogical adaptations, generally characterized by the increasing use of technology and digital and audiovisual resources. In early 2020
The pedagogical approach presented here focuses on the genre of Elevator Pitch presentations. This genre was chosen to develop students’ multimodal competence and literacy, as well as their creativity and critical thinking skills. This genre falls into the category of blitz or rapid-fire presentations and is characterized by its brevity (Harinck & van Leeuwen
The model devised for this study involves a contextualized language teaching/learning experience in which students go through systematized phases aimed to enhance their multimodal competence and literacy. Table 1 presents the structure of the multimodal genre-based approach developed for the study.Table 1Phases and steps within the multimodal genre-based model. (Based on Beltrán-Palanques, 2022; Querol-Julián & Beltrán-Palanques
The joint deconstruction phase comprises two steps: Introduction and genre presentation (1.1.) and Sample analysis and discussion: multimodal deconstruction (1.2.). In the first step (1.1.), the teacher
To start working on their presentations (2.2.) and receive support from the teacher and their peers (2.3.), the students were asked to generate ideas (ideational meaning) for their Elevator Pitch. They were asked to think of innovative ideas/products framed within their field of expertise. Since the Elevator Pitch presentations had to be performed individually
Based on the teacher’s experience, we may point out that the interaction generated on the Discord rooms was different from that on Google Meet. When the students were in their breakout rooms
The students were requested to justify their responses. Six students claimed that in an asynchronous presentation they had more time to prepare and video-record themselves as many times as necessary to improve their delivery. Likewise, nine students commented that the synchronous modality would be more challenging because of the impossibility of editing and restarting the presentation. Another key aspect was the presence of the audience. Specifically
The survey shed some light on the students’ experience throughout the implementation of the multimodal genre-based approach. The findings suggest that the students were generally satisfied with both teaching formats, even though they showed a preference for the face-to-face classroom. With reference to the interactive nature of the two sessions
This chapter invites reflection on how digital technologies can support and facilitate language teaching and learning. As described in this chapter, digitalizing and moving into an online environment goes beyond the mere use of technology. A well-defined methodological approach is required to better adapt pedagogical practices to the new teaching formats (González-Lloret
The second part of the study focused on the students’ learning experience throughout the pedagogical proposal. For this purpose, a survey was administrated upon its implementation. Overall
Remote working and learning scenarios are not only necessary under certain social or global circumstances but are also currently becoming more and more accepted. Online elements offer different substantial benefits, but they must be consistently evaluated and improved in order to maintain their status within our economic and educational system. The current chapter aims at presenting an exercise that can be used to optimize learners’ pronunciation of English in an online-based environment by combining theoretical aspects of linguistics with practical ideas for the virtual classroom. Praat
Learning a foreign language can imply that individuals are exposed to linguistic structures or phenomena in the target language that their native language does not use. Cross-linguistic variation can be detected on multiple levels such as the syntactic, morphological
Speaking is one of the key competences when learning a foreign language and accurate pronunciation can facilitate communication (see, e.g.
Our exercise presented later connects to a large body of research on pronunciation learning and teaching in general and with the help of technology in particular (see among many others, e.g.
In order to achieve the ultimate goal of our idea, namely an improved pronunciation of English interdental fricatives
The details described give learners a first objective and acoustic feedback about whether the realization of the interdental fricative is accurate. Of course, the pictures vary from person to person and from situation to situation to some extent

Reading in an L2 is a complex skill that has been claimed to be facilitated by serious games. Serious games in online environments have the potential to draw learners’ attention to language and to personalize learning. This innovation experience presents a serious game that uses an algorithmic sequence for the presentation of linguistic units for the acquisition of reading skills. The game also gives teachers the opportunity to alter the algorithmic path. The goal is to explore gameplay behavior and teachers’ perceptions of adaptivity and learning. 105 students played games for over 4 months and 7 teachers participated in the training and interviews. This study draws both on quantitative data coming from gameplay, and qualitative data coming from teacher interviews. Results show that the algorithmic sequence triggered a wider variety of features played from basically grapheme-phoneme correspondence. Teachers used the teacher tool to cover a more limited variety of features but from a wider range of linguistic dimensions and with more games per feature. Data from interviews suggest that teachers had a range of perceptions regarding the connection of the tools to their own goals
Reading in a second or foreign language is a complex skill that requires long periods of training before it is mastered. In recent years, games have caught researchers’ and educators’ attention (Yu
Reading acquisition is a crucial skill for language as well as overall cognitive, academic
Reading comprehension is an acquired skill that combines a series of innate component skills and processes, and it requires extensive periods of training before it is mastered (Cain et al.
In educational contexts reading is typically both a group experience (whole class reading) as well as an individual one (silent reading). One of the challenges with reading is that reading skills are acquired at different paces by each learner in accordance with learners’ abilities and internal syllabi for language acquisition. As a possible solution to such a challenge, more recently serious games have begun to include complex adaptive algorithms in an attempt to personalize the learning trajectories of game users. As an instantiation of the more general and still debatable concept of personalization (Vanbecelaere et al.
Algorithmic sequences make use of the concept of personalization and adaptivity as its instantiation in order to test the effectiveness of adaptive reading games on reading acquisition. So far some studies looking at reading accuracy and fluency have returned mixed results (Vanbecelaere et al., 2020; Kartal & Terziyan
How are gameplay experience and learning affected by the algorithmic, adaptive sequence as opposed to a teacher-led sequence?
iRead is an innovation project funded by the EU (grant agreement No 731724) promoting the creation of infrastructure and tools for the promotion of reading skills in different languages (English, Spanish
System-external instruments measured learner’s individual differences in reading skills and were used at pre-test and post-test. The test included a list of L2 words for measuring reading accuracy and a list of L2 non-words for the measurement of reading accuracy (developed by the iRead members at University College London), and a reading fluency test taken from the FAIR-FS test (Foorman et al.
System-internal data including the number of games and number of features per game among others were obtained utilizing the learning analytics embedded in the iRead infrastructure and were extracted via Tableau. All actions of the participants’ gameplay were recorded by the iRead infrastructure. Data collected by the game that is pertinent to this study included the total number of games played, the total number of features played
As for the issue of adaptivity, in general teachers reported a positive attitude towards the idea of personalization and adaptivity. They either noticed adaptivity in the game itself by letting the game choose the contents:FPT1NEY2: “The students that have more problems
This finding suggests that whether coming from the system (algorithmic adaptivity) or from teachers themselves (teacher-led adaptivity), all teachers perceived that the system offered them the opportunity to adapt to different individual learners or different groups of learners
As per our results regarding adaptivity, teachers ranged from simply noticing it
Serious games have the potential to impact second language development of reading skills. Our data showed that there was progress in reading accuracy and fluency. In the case of the iRead system, however
The results of the teacher questionnaire were analyzed quantitatively and used to make decisions about the structure, content
Teachers’ answers showed that they believed a test should contain activities looking into learners’ prior knowledge of the language skills (cf. Table 1). Therefore, it was decided that the test should consist of four parts
Descriptive statistics of the rank order of the 177 representations (written texts) that resulted from the comparative judgment procedure are given in the results section. To investigate the reliability of the rank order, the scale separation reliability (SSR) was calculated. Verhavert et al. (2018) found this measure (with values between 0 and 1) can be used as an index for interrater reliability in comparative judgment.
The raters’ work resulted in a reliable rank order of the 177 representations. In the current study, the SSR was high (.88)
We then compared the results of the comparative judgment procedure for the three different picture stories and chose the picture story with the best spread in results. The boxplot in Fig. 2 shows the spread of the scores of each representation (written text) per picture story. In Table 2, the descriptive statistics for the results of the comparative judgment procedure for the representations per picture story are given. Figure 2 and Table 2 show that the spread in the representations for story B (which is the example story given in Fig. 1) is almost evenly divided. The mean ability is around zero
We also aimed to investigate whether and how benchmark texts gathered via a two-stage approach can be integrated into an online tool that aims to assess L2 English writing skills. It was shown that the benchmark texts resulting from this approach can be integrated into an online tool that aims to map pupils’ prior knowledge at the start of formal instruction. In the future, a similar approach could be followed for writing at a different level or with a different type of task and the use of benchmark texts could be integrated into other online tools in a similar manner.
The process leading to the choice of representative benchmark texts is quite time-consuming because a large group of raters and a lot of representations are necessary for the comparative judgment procedure to render highly reliable results. However, once this step has been taken
In a follow-up study researchers could develop materials for teachers to tackle these differences in their L2 English classes but this was not within the scope of our project, which focused on the development of an online tool to assess learners’ prior knowledge. Future studies could also investigate the differences between scores given using rubrics and scores given via the two-stage approach.
One of the biggest challenges in the development of the tool was finding a reliable and efficient way to assess learners’ written tasks. We decided to explore the possibility of using benchmark texts gathered in a two-stage approach. Overall, the two-stage approach combining comparative judgment and benchmark texts showed to be a good method to ensure reliable results when rating beginners’ L2 narrative writing. This was shown by the interrater reliability in the second part of the study. Furthermore

Even though these applications are not necessarily designed for language learning purposes, they are becoming a prominent tool in language learning. Multiple studies have shown that ASR tools can support classroom activities and have great potential to assist with language learning (e.g.
Evers and Chen (2020) observed how different learning styles (visual/verbal) and other types of feedback affected English as a Foreign Langauge (EFL) adult learners who practiced pronunciation using ASR technology. Out of three groups (1–receiving pronunciation feedback from a teacher, 2–receiving feedback from ASR and peers
ASR software holds undeniable potential for language-learning purposes. Still, since the success of its execution heavily depends on the software’s capabilities and the surroundings
Further analysis of the relationship between the accuracy rate of the STT applications and each task offers more insight into which of the five applications can provide the highest accuracy of evaluation, judging by the language learner’s proficiency level. A Pearson correlation test between proficiency levels and each STT application showed that “Transcribe” and Windows 10’s Dictation tool related most strongly to proficiency levels (see Table 5).Table 5Pearson’s correlations between STT applications’ accuracy scores and each task
It is important to follow some ground rules and recommendations to help English learners have the best pronunciation practice experience with ASR technology. The first thing to consider is the STT platform that will be used for pronunciation practice. This may depend on the software and hardware available at hand. Some schools strictly control software that can be accessed on school grounds. Other institutions may be flexible but do not have funds to provide the necessary hardware to individual classes. Computer labs may be occupied with people quietly working on their projects (McCrocklin, 2015
The use of mobile applications for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teaching and learning has become widespread at all educational levels, increasing the difficulty in identifying the most technically and pedagogically suitable application for a specific teaching context. Although digital skills should be a central component in (prospective) FL teachers’ qualifications as one of their twenty-first-century skills
This paper aims to raise teachers’ awareness of using digital tools in the foreign English classroom and foster their critical stance on how these apps may constitute a means towards the final aim of effective language learning. Similarly, it attempts to provide a functional and accessible checklist to evaluate apps in view of their technical
This paper introduces the different types of mobile applications and reviews their use in FL learning and teaching, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. In the next section
When introducing mobile apps in the teaching and learning processes, it would be necessary to distinguish the more suitable app for students and the purpose of their use. Moreover
The rapid advancement of technology and the proliferation of apps in the market make their inclusion in the language teaching-learning process almost unavoidable in many educational contexts around the world. Although the use of apps can be advantageous in learning any foreign language, in this section
The interactivity of language apps is also presented as a plus since users can discover new content through communication with the app and other users (Khaddage et al., 2016; Klímová
Although apps are presented as practical tools to develop the four basic skills, the language component of vocabulary seems to be the most prominent one in the language apps (Klímová & Poláková
Rodríguez-Arancón et al. (2013) adapted the taxonomy to evaluate open resources developed by Fernández-Pampillón Cesteros et al. (2013) to be used for educational apps. They incorporated ten categories: pedagogical ones such as cognitive value and pedagogic coherence, which refers to “the application’s goals and the specification of its target users and skills developed” (Rodríguez-Arancón et al.
A number of prevalent criteria are included in the frameworks considered above. Pedagogical issues such as the capacity to generate learning, relevance
Since our objective is to increase prospective and/or novice teachers’ awareness of the pedagogical usefulness of language teaching apps for foreign language learning, a checklist is proposed (see the Appendix for the full version of the checklist). This checklist has been developed and justified following recent literature (Chen
Mobile apps can provide numerous benefits to students as they can be used as a learning tool both outside and inside the FL classroom. However, the rapid and constant appearance of new apps on the market can imply a challenge for novice or prospective FL teachers since deciding which mobile app is technically feasible and
